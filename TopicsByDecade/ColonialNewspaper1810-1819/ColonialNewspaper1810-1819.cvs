ID1,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1811,08,26,inform,Commerce of Canada.Extract of a letter. The population of Canada in 1760 was reckoned at 62000 souls whilst her exports had never exceeded two millions of livres tournois (about 90000l) The imports must have greatly exceeded the exports ; but not even a conjecture of the differences can be formed. The present population of the Canadas may be rated at 320000 souls ; but great as this augmentation may appear commerce will be found to have greatly surpassed the proportional ratio of the population.From 1763 to 1793 the exports may have varied from 120000l. to 300000l. chiefly of wheat furs and peltry. But during the last 18 years they have increased to the surprising sum of 1220963l. 10s. Sterling as we shall presently perceive by the following estimate which cannot be much over or under the truth :-Furs and skims ... 105000 0 Wheat all other grain flour and biscuit 136500 0 Lumber of all descriptions ... 536500 0 Pot and pearl ashes ... 223000 0 Beets and pork 30000 0 Sundries (too tedious to particularise) ... 16000 10 The hulls masts and yards of 28 vessels built in the province ... 84000 0 Total of domestic produce 1131000 0 Sundry goods imported and exported 4780 0 1125780 0Commissions and additional charges at 7 1/2 per cent. Sterling ... 65183 0 t. 1220963 10The amounts of imports of dutiable articles at Quebec is about 380000l. Sterling. It is impossible to ascertain the value of goods not dutiable ; but we may safely conlude that they will make the total of importans one million Sterling leaving a balance in favour of these provinces which but a few years ago would have appeared incredible. This property is carried by 661 vessels whose tonnage is 143893 navigated by 6758 seamen. The freight and primage on these vessels are nine guineas per ton being 1359788l. 17s. Sterling which without taking into consideration the charges in Britain will make the gross amount of our cargoes landed exceed 3000000l. Sterling being about a tenth of the imports of the United Kingdom.Our commerce has become considerable with the United States. A few years ago our imports from thence greatly exceeded our exports. But since respectable and intelligent American merchants have begun to settle amongst us I believe the scale turned in our favour ; and thus British industry is commencing to run in a channel never before much thought of.,
ID103,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1810,06,09,inform,Canada Extract of a letter from a Gentleman to his Friend in GlasgowQuebec March 23 1810.–A number of leading characters among the Canadians who were Members of the House of Assembly (twice dissolved for improper conduct) and the proprietor of a French paper called La Canadien have been arrested and thrown into jail upon a charge of treasonable and seditious practises ; the printing press types &c. also taken possession of. This vigorous measure of Sir James Craig has astonished the Canadians not a little but the consequences will be no doubt beneficial to the country as it has crushed a faction which has for some years been gaining strength and acquiring dangerous ingluence over the minds of the inhabitants who are without education and ignorant of course in the extreme ; therefore easily misled by demagogues among their countrymen who seize every opportunity of stirring up all those prejudices which the people of this country naturally have against the British : for having been allowed to preserve their language they are nearly as much Frenchmen now as they were at the conquest.Quebec March 22.–On Sunday afternoon the printer of the Canadien Mr Charles Lafrancois was arrested and committed to jail under a warrant from the Executive Council on a charge of treasonable practises. On Monday evening Dr Blanchet and Mr Bedard and last evening Mr T. Taschereau were also arrested and committed by the same authority on the same charges.The Commander in Chief in Scotland gave an elegant dinner at head-quarters on the 4th curt. to celebrate the King's birthday-day–at which several of the Nobility and Gentry Generals and Field-Officers of the army were present.Among the other accidents that occurred on the King's birth-day from the imprudent use of gunpowder is the death of girl in Richmond Street.– Her clothes were set fire by a squib and although immediately taken to the Infirmary was so severely burnt that she died before morning.A very melancholy accident happened at a place called the Pease Berwickshire. As one of the baggage carts of the Forfarshire militia was stopping there a fine boy about eight years of age belonging to Serjeant-Major Nicol got out of the cart and was climbing on the wheel when the horses suddengoing off threw him on the ground and the wheel passing over his body crushed him to death. The unfortunate mother was upon the cart when this unhappy accident happened.On Thursday night a spirit shop in Gibson-street Glasgow was broken into and about five pounds in silver a seven shilling piece about eight shillings of copper a counterfeit half-guinea and a pocket-book containing some bills and papers carried ; some partial payments are marked on the bills. The villians appear to have entered the shop by forcing up the window shutter with an iron bar and then breaking a pane of glass by which they got the iron bolts and the window opened.On Sturday last a porter was killed in the hold of a vessel in Dundee harbour. He was engaged unloading coals ; and the rope by which the iron pully was supported giving way the measure fell down upon him and killed him instantly.A few days ago a mason of the name of Stevenson was killed by the blowing up of some stones at Templeton in the parish of Auchterhouse. The match unfortunately communicated too early to the powder and the explosion took place before he could get out of the way. He has left a wife and two children to lament his loss.,
ID104,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,08,29,inform,Canada Montreal July 4This city has been for a few days past in a state of agitation occasioned by an event which has taken place at Pointe Claire ; and as this matter will be clothed no doubt in all the dress of misrepresentatation by our neighbouring enemies from the information they may receive of it we consider it a dury we owe to the community at large in this country to state the circumstances as they occurred in a fair open and candid manner.By the late militia law 2000 young men are to be drafted from the general militia of the province for three months to be properly trained and of course a certain proportion of this number is to be furnished by each particular district. Some those drafted from the Parish of Pointe Claire refused to march to Lapraire for the purpose of joining the divion stationed there ; in consequence of which Major Leprohon belonging to this particular battalion was sent on Tuesday last with 22 attendants to apprehend these refractory persons as deserters.They apprehended four with some opposition ; and on their way to town with them they were followed by a considerable number of persons who rescued one prisoner and threatened that they would next day proceed to the depot at Lapraire and bring away by force from thence the young men of the parish who were there on duty. Accordingly on Wednesday a large body of these people assembled at La Chine with the intention of carrying their threats into execution.Thomas M'Cord Esq. one of the Police Magistrates about four o'clock in the afternoon left town accompanied by the light infantry of the 49th regiment and a detachment of the royal artillery with two field-pieces under the command of Major Plenderleath and took post on a point opposite to the insurgents (consisting of about 400 persons 87 of whom appeared to be armed) and at the distance[?] of about two acres. Mr M'Cord with some other respectable citizens pointed out the impropriety of their conduct and the fate that would unfortunately await their perseverance ; urging them by every persuasion to disperse and return peaceably to their horses and obey the law.They replied that they did not consider the militia bill as fully passed–that they were informed it had not received the Royal sanction ; and that although it might have passed the House of Assembly where it originated it had not obtained the approbation of the other branches of the Legislate ; that the law if really enacted had not been promagated amongst them and that they were not properly made acquainted with it ; as such they could not pay obedience to it.Under this false and unfortunate impression these deluded people persisted ; but at the same time declared with shouts of Vive le Roi that if the Government wanted their services at any time they were ready one and all to come forward with their lives in the defence of their country and that they would prove themselves in the hour of danger to be faithful subjects to a Government to which they were firmly attached by every principle.Finding however that they still persisted in their determination on this particular object Mr M'Cord in his Magisterial capacity read the riot act to them and ordered them to disperse ; which not being complied with a round shot was fired by the artillery but elevated above injury which was returned by the insurgents in a spirited fire with ball deserving of a better cause. The troops then fired a volley with ball and grape but still too much elevated to do any harm which was also returned by another discharge from the mob upon which a few direct shots were fired at them (it being nearly dark) by the military which made them disperse and one man was found killed and another wounded it is feared mortally.,
ID105,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,10,03,inform,Upper Canada York July 28.Yesterday at an early hour his Honour Isaac Brock Esq. administering the Government of Upper Canada and Major-General commanding his Majesty's forces therein arrived at this place from Fort-George and accompanied by a numerous suite proceeded to the Government Building at four p.m. when he opened the present extra session of the Legislature and delivered the following speech to both houses :–Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislature Council and Gentlemen of the House of AssemblyThe urgency of the present crisis is the only consideration which would have induced me to call you together at a time when public as well as private duties elsewhere demand your care and attention.But Gentlemen when invaded by an enemy whose avowed object is the entire conquest of this province the voice of loyalty as well as of interest calls aloud to every person in the sphere in which he is placed to defend his country.Our militia have heard that voice and have obeyed it ; they have evinced by the promptitude and loyalty of their conduct that they are worthy of the King whom they serve and of the constitution which they enjoy ; and it affords me particulary satisfaction that while I address you as Legislators I speak to mean who in the day of danger will be ready to assist not only with their counsels but with their arms.We look Gentlemen to our militia as well as to the regular forces for our protection ; but I should be wanting to that important trust committed to my care if I attempted to conceal (what experience the great instructor of mankind especially of legislators has discovered) that amendment in our militia laws is necessary to render them efficient. It is for you to consider what further improvements they still may require.Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and Gentlemen of the House of AssemblyFrom the history and experience of our mother country we learn that in times of actual invasion or interal commotion the ordinary course of criminal laws has been found in adequate to secure his Majesty's Government from private treachery as well as from open disaffection ; and that at such times its Legislature has found it expedient to enact laws restraining for a limited period the liberty of individuals in many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the particulars of the charge ; and although the actual invasion of the province might justify me in the exercise of the full power reposed in me on such an emergency yet it will be more agreeable to me to receive the sanction of the Houses.A few traitors have already joined the enemy–have been suffered to come into the country with impunity–and have been harboured and concealed in the interior ; yet the general spirit of loyalty which appears to pervade the inhabitants of this province is such as to authorise a just expectation that their efforts to mislead and deceive will be unavailing– The disaffected I am convinced are few–To protect and defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations is an object worthy of your most serious deliberations.The speech concludes with a call for supplies.ProclamationThe unprovoked declaration of war by the United States of America against the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and its dependencies has been followed by the actual invasion of this province in a remote frontier of the western disticts by a detachment of the United States. The officer commanding that detachment has thought proper to invite his Majesty's subjects not merely to a quiet and unresisting submission but insults them with a call to seek voluntarily the protection of his Government.Without condescending to repeat the illiberal epithets bestowed in this appeal of the American Commander to the people of Upper Canada on the administration of his Majesty every inhabitant of the province is desired to seek the confutation of such indecent slander in the review of his own particular cirumstances. Where is the Canadian subject who can truly affirm to himself that he has been injured by the Government in his person his property or his liberty? Where is to be found in any part of the world a growth so paid in prosperity and wealth as this colony exhibits? Settled not thirty years by a band of veterans exiled from their former possessions on account of their loyalty not a descendant of these brave people it to be found who under the fostering liberality of their Sovereign has not acquired a property and means of enjoyment superior to what were possessed by their ancestors. This unequalled prosperity would not have been attained by the utmost liberality of the Government or the persevering industry of the people had not the maritime power of the mother country secured to its colonists a safe access to every market where the produce of their labour was in request. The unavoidable and immediate consequence of a separation from Great Britain must be the loss of this inestimable advantage and what is offered to you in exchange? To become a territory of the United States and share with them that exclusion from the ocean which the policy of their Government enforces ; you are not even flattered with a participation of their boasted independence ; and it is but too obvious that once exchanged from the powerful protection of the United Kingdom you must be re-annexed to the dominion of France from which the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms of Great Britain at vast expence of blood and treasure from no other motive than to relieve her ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel neighbour ; the restitution of Canada to the empire of France was the stipulated reward for the aid afforded to the revolted colonies now the United States ; the debt is still due and there can be no doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consideration for commercial advantages or rather for an expected relaxation in the tyranny of France over the commercial world. Are you prepared inhabitants of Canada to become willing subjects or rather slaves to the despot who rules the nation of Europe with a rod of iron? If not arise in a body exert your energies co-operate cordially with the King's regular forces to repel the invader and do not give cause to your children when groaning under the oppression of a foreign master to reproach you with having too easily parted with the richest inheritance of this earth–a participation in the name character and freedom of Britain.[The proclamation concludes with a declaration that should the Americans refused quarter in consequence of Indians being found in Canadian ranks that a severe and rigorous retaliation will take place.]Isaac Brock Major-Gen. and President Head-quarters Fort George July 22 1812.,
ID106,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,10,03,inform,Quebec PapersProvincial Parliament of Lower Canada Legislative Council–Aug 1.This day at two o'clock his Excellency the Governor in Chief went in the usual state to the Legislative Council Chamber and being seated on the Throne the Gentlemen Usher of the Black Rod was sent to command the presence of the Assembly which being come up the Honourable Speaker of the Assembly said–May it please your ExcellencyHis Majesty's faithful subjects the representatives of the province of Lower Canada have passed a bill intituled An Act of facilitate the Circulation of Army Bills. Their loyalty and the happiness of this province in being connected with and powerfully protected by the British nation are the basis of their constitution and the just grounds which gave rise to the formation of the militia and the firm determination to defend this country against the unexpected and unjust war that the United States have lately declared ; they are therefore under the greatest obligation to your Excellency for having communicated to them your wise precautions on the means to ameliorate and insure for several years the punctual payment of the army by circulating bills the reimbursement of which is guaranteed in England. To give them greater credit the bill limits the sums necessary and moreover provides for the interest the advantages accruing therefrom and even for the payment of the principal in specie in this province which has become expressly bound for the same at a fixed period to any person whatever who from the state of his private affairs would prefer such payment.In full confidence that under the present and any unforeseen circumstance your Excellency is invested with all necessary authority the representatives of the province and their constituents rely on the wisdom already experienced of your administration and in the name of the Commons of Lower Canada I have the honour to present this bill to your Excellency humbly requesting thereto his Majesty's assent.His Excellency was pleased to signify the Royal assent.His Excellency then addressed both Houses and the Provincial Parliament was prorogued to the 16th of September.,
ID107,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,11,09,inform,War in CanadaExtract of a letter from Montreal Sept. 25 Our Friend Mr – arrived in town from New York a few days ago. On his way he passed three days at Plattsburgh the head-quarters of the American army which from ocular observation he states to consist of 8 or 10000 men under the command of General Bloomfield Mooar and Petit. This force is composed of 3 or 4000 regulars about the same number of militia and some volunteers from the southward. The militia is almost all from the state of New York for the Yankees still refuse to march. with this force no doubt is entertained here but theywill make an attack ; and if they mean to make it this season they must be prompt in their movements for the weather is getting cold and they are not well clothed or appointed. Mr – indeed states half of them to be without shoes or stockings which will never do for a winter campaign in this country. To repel the threatened attack we are making every preparation in our power and the Canadians seem well disposed to second the Government. Sir George Prevost has established a cordon the left of which is at Chambly and extending to Chateaguny ; the main encampment is half way between St John's and La Prairie. Colonel Murray is at St John's with a battalion ; and the Isle-au Noix is strongly fortified with a boom and a chain secured across the river. This line of defence is composed of four regiments of the line and 2000 drafted militia with a corps of about 400 Canadian voltigeurs raised last spring. The Royals a very strong battalion lately arrived from the West Indies are now marching to join the camp. The citizens both here and at Quebec mount guard and do garrison : indeed there are in this island (Montreal) five battalions of militia say 3 to 4000 men pretty well disciplined and who on an alarm could march to this cordon in half a day.– A new regiment of embodied militia has lately been formed by drafts from the different regiments of inrolled militia in this island and old Major Murray is appointed Lieutenant-Colonel. The gentlemen of the North-west Company army are forming a corps of their voyageurs who will be most useful troops to act in advance with the Indians. The number originally proposed was 200 but the men have come forward so handsomely that they are to consist of 500. Mr M'Gillivray is Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of this corps Mr Shaw Major and the other partners of the Company are Captains and subalterns ; so that the men being commanded by those whom they have accustomed to obey may be considered as already disciplined at least in point of subordination.Sir George confines his operations to mere defence. La Motte with about 70 Indians advanced through the woods about ten days ago within hearing of this redoubtable army and set up a war whoop which so completely terrified them that though they could see no enemy they lay on their arms for two two successive nights in no expectation of an attack–to prevent which they cut down their best bridge and destroyed all the roads by which I suppose they mean to invade us. Mr – who was several days at their headquarters and who was offered the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the army has it is said proposed to Sir George to destroy their camp with 500 men ; and Sir George is said to have replied that his plan was fixed not to make any attack nor to send a man across the line.This forebearance which the Yankees impute to fear or weakness tends only to increase their insolent swaggering and their enmity is to inveterate to be allayed by any thing but hard knocks.,
ID108,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1813,10,16,inform,CanadaThe Rota frigate arrived on Monday off Plymouth with a fleet from Halifax under convoy and passed up the channel with the chief part of the trade. From the Hydra transport which put into Plymouth we have received the following official notification of Sir James Yeo's success on Lake Ontario the American notices of which have already been published.Bulletin.Head-quarters Kingston Aug. 14. 1813 By accounts received from his Excellency the Governor in Chief and Commander of the forces from Commodore Sir James Yeo dated off York half-past one P.M. on the 11th instant the following particulars have been transmitted of the capture and loss of the enemy's armed schooners:–On Thursday evening last the 10th instant the enemy's squadron under the Command of Commodore Chauncey got under weigh from their anchorage off the mouth of Niagara River and with a fine breeze from the east stood towards our fleet which were becalmed off the port of Twelve Mile Creek. At sun-set a breeze coming off the land gave us the wind of the enemy when our squadron stood for them on which immediately bore away from us under as much sail as their schooners could carry to keep up with their larger vessels. The enemy's fleet formed a long. The Pike Madison Oneida and six schooners (two schooners were placed to windward for the purpose of raking the masts of our squadron as it should come up). At eleven the squadron got within gun-shot of the schooners when they opened a brisk fire and from their going so fast it was more than an hour before the Wolf our headmost ship could pass them ; at this time the rest of the squadron was two and three miles astern of the Wolf and on her coming up with the Madison and Pike they put before the wind and made sail firing their stern-chasers.– Sir J. Yeo finding it impossible to get the squadron up with the enemy as the Wolf was the only ship which could keep up with them then made sail between them and the two schooners to wind ward which he captured and which are called the Julia and Growler each carrying one long 32 pounder and long 12-pounder and 40 men.– Two of the enemy's largest schooners the Scourge of 10 and Hamilton of nine guns upset on the night of the 9th in carrying sail and all on board perished (about 100 in number). By this loss and capture the enemy's squadron are reduced to 10 vessels and our's increased to eight. It is ascertained that the Pike mounts 28 long 24-pounders and 420 men the Madison 22 long 32 pounders and 340 men. Boat loads of troops were taken on board the enemy's squadron on Monday last for the purpose it is supposed of repelling the boarders.– The Wolf has not received any material injury and not a person hurt. The prisoners were landed on the 11th instant and the Growler's damage repaired. She had lost her bowsprit and was otherwise cut up.Nothing could exceed the eagerness and enthusiasm of the officers and men in our squadron for a close engagement.,
ID109,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1813,10,07,inform,Canada. (From the Quebec Mercury.) Attack on Fort Schlosser. Head-quarters Kingston July 13.By accounts from the army under Major-General De Rottenburg dated the 9th instant the following particulars have been received of a bold and successful attempt to surprise the American post at Fort Schlosser.In the night of the 4th instant a party consisting of Volunteer Thompson and six privates of the 49th regiment under Ensign Winder and thirty-four of the militia the whole under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Clarke of the Lincoln militia crossed over in boats from Chippawa to Fort Schlosser which they reached a little before day-break and completely surprised the guard consisting of two Lieutenants one serjeant and eight privates whom they made prisoners together with three civilians and three of our own subjects found in the Fort.– The party remained in the Fort about one hour loading their boats form the public stores and wharf and brought with them one brass six-pounder 57 stand of arms two and a half kegs of musket ball cartridges 6 bulwarks of musket proof curtains for boats one gun-boat two batteaux 20 barrels of salt 17 casks tobacco eight barrels of pork and one barrel of whiskey with a number of spades oars and axes ; a small party of the enemy had collected as the last boast pushed off from the shore and several shots were fired but the boats returned to Chippawa with their prisoners and the articles they had captured without a man being hurt on this service. Further accounts have also been received from the army highly creditable to the Indian warriors serving with it. On the 8th instant a party of the King's regiment and a body of Indian warriors were sent to endeavour to recover a considerable quantity of medicines and surgical instruments which had been buried near the Fort George when our troops retired from it. A skirmish ensued in consequence between the Indians and the enemy in which the latter lost one officer and 20 men killed and 10 taken prisoners–the whole of the medicines and instruments were brought off by the party of the King's; the only loss sustained being three Indians wounded. Captain Norton led the Indian warriors with great spirit ; and much credit is due to Captain Merrit of the Provincial dragoons for reconnoitering the spot where the medicines were deposited and conducting the party to it.A few nights ago the barracks at Gravelly Point burnt by our gun-boats and more than 100 barrels of pork flour and other articles brought away from thence together with a very fine Durham boat–500 oars colleced and partly loaded in her for Sacket's Harbour being destroyed.Attack on Black Rock Head-quarters Kingston July 15 1813.G. O.–His Excellency the Commander of the forces has received a dispatch from Major General De Rottenburg reporting a successful attack upon the enemy's post and dockyard at Black Rock at daybreak on the morning of the 11th inst. by detachments of the King's and 41st regiments together with Liutenant Fitzgibbon's party of the 49th and about 40 militia the whole amounting to 240 men under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp. The enemy's position was carried by a spirited attack without the loss of a single man. Several large boats loaded with stores and provisions and three field pieces a twelve and two six-pounders were brought away ; a vessel and all the naval store-houses and barracks have been burnt.Unfortunately before the evacuation of the post was completed a strong reinforcement of the enemy aided by Indians pressed this small detachment by which Captain Saunders of the 41st and 15 men were killed ; Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp Lieutenant Montpesson of the 41st and 15 rank and file wound ed. The wounded were brought over.Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp has received three wounds severe but not considered dangerous.By his Excellency's commandEdward Baynes Adjutant-GeneralBritish Expedition to PlattsburghThe following is an extract of a letter from a respectable citizen at Burlington dated Aug. 1. 1813An express arrived at Burlington on the 30th July with intelligence that the British had left the Isle au Noix with a force consisting of the two armed sloops of 11 guns each and four gallies of one gun each and 100 batteaux full of men and had progressed within one mile of the town. The camp was instantly alarmed and the troops under arms but no enemy appeared. Next day we learnt that about 1000 troops under the command of Colonel Murray had landed and took possession of Plattsburgh without opposition there being no force to oppose them except the militia of the town and vicinity who being only 400 in number retreated as the enemy advanced. The arsenal belonging to the State Pike's encampment barracks at Serenac cantonment and every building belonging to the United States were immediately burnt. The enemy obtained both provisions and stores. The loss cannot be less than 50000 dollars. The enemy left Plattsburgh on the 1st and are understood to be proceeding this way [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] On General Dearborn invading Canada and taking possession of Fort George he sent off to Greenbush as prisoners of war the following respectable inhabitants : Messrs Edwards Murehead Dickson Lyminston Lawe two Kerrs M'Ewan Parson Addison Howell Heron Green Baldwin Clinch Jones Ball Decoe and John Crook. Messrs Lawe M'Ewen and the two Kerrs were wounded on the 27th June. General Dearborn expected that the inhabitants would have joined the Americans.General Dearborn resigned the command of the Niagara army on the 23th June on account of indisposition. General Lewis says in his dispatch to Secretary at War that he did not think the General would ever again be fit for service ; that the unfortunate events of the war had deranged his understanding ; and that thought sometimes in a state of convalescence he uniformly relapsed when military topics were alluded to. General Lewis having been nominated to command at Sacket's Harbour is succeeded at Fort George Niagara and on the Canadian frontier by General Boyd.The Indian chief Tecumseh has seized the favourable moment of the diversion by our shipping in Virginia for surround Fort Meigs with 2000 warriors. He had deprived the garrison of all the possibility of receiving supplies. General Clay who commanded there had written urgently to General Harrison for assistance. The latter was collecting his army to march to his relief.Sir James Yeo after the retreat of the enemy's army at Fort George swept the American side of Lake Ontario. He landed a body of troops at Great Sodus and took the whole of the provisions consisting of several hundred barrels of pork and flour and burnt the buildings. The British loss was a serjeant and four privates of the Royal killed. At Genessee River he inflicted the same loss on the enemy taking 500 barrels of pork and 1700 bushels of corn. The provisions were delivered to General Vincent. Four companies of the Royals were embarked on board the fleet to serve as marinersThere were at Quebec on the 22d July 1000 American prisoners of war captured since the commencement of the campaign. At Beaufort there were 50 officers including three General. In consequence of the conduct of the American Government and of the officers the latter are no longer permitted to return home on parole. The Melpomene frigate with De Meuron's regiment from the Mediterranean arrived in the river St. Lawrence on the 20th July.James Gready private in the 8th or King's regiment and Terence Hunt private in the 6th foot were in the latter end of June tried by Court Martials for deserting to the enemy and being found in arms and were publicy shot at Kingston Canada pursuant to their sentence.It appears from the Quebec papers and from the general orders issued by the Commander in Chief in Canada that on the late defeat of General Wilkinson on the banks of the Miami river the American military chest containing 15000l. Sterling was among the property captured by the British.Captain Waugh of the 103d regiment died at Chamely on the 2d July.General Hampton has arrested Colonel Clark the late commandant at Burlington for a defalcation of about 50000 dollars.,
ID110,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1813,12,30,inform,Victory in CanadaBy the Dunlop Captain Abrams arrived on Sunday last at Greenock from Quebec after a passage of 36 days papers and letters have been received from Canada to the 19th which contain an amount of an engagement between a detachment of the British force under Lieut.-Col. Morrison consisting of the 49th[?] and 89th regiments with some companies of the Canadian militia and a body of American troops amounting to 4000 men which ended in the defeat of the latter with great loss. This action was produced by the attempt of the American General to advance to Montreal from which it appears however he has now begun to measure back his steps having crossed to the American side of the river where the action was fought and being actively pur sued in his retreat by the British troops.The following information has been received by the Alexander Captain Henry which arrived at Liverpool on Tuesday:–Quebec Nov. 26. 1813 The enemy's whole force was about 8000 men under the command of General Wilkinson. The division commanded by General Boyd consisting of about 3000 to 4000 infantry cavalry &c. was alone engaged upon the 11th instant.The enemy lost in the action Brigadier Gen.Conington and Colonel Preston killed–probably 600 men killed wounded and taken.The consequence was a precipitate retreat across the St Lawrence at Cornwall on the 13th and evacuating the province. General Wilkinson marched his troops into the Straits the route of Plattsburgh leaving all his boats upwards of 300 in the Salmon river where they were frozen in on the 16th and 2000 men to protect them.Colonel Plenderleath came home in the Alexander with dispatches.,
ID111,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1814,03,19,inform,Destruction of a Moravian Settlement in CanadaThe following letter received in town gives a description of the wanton and barbarous conduct of the American army in destroying a settlement of the Moravian missionaries in their late irruption into province:–Yesterday I received a very afflicting account from North America by a letter from New York dated Dec. 27 1813 concerning a report of the total destruction of our settlement [?] [?] on the 6th of October by the American army under General Harrison. It was the consequence of the invasion[?] of that province after the capture of the little fleet on Lake Erle and the defeat of the s[?]al British force under the [?] of occupying the Chapel and some other houses for our[?] sick British soldiers and considering the danger the Christian Indians were in from the malice of the Americans it was his advice that the Missionaries and the Indian Congregation should retreat[?] farther into the country. When the Americans were successful in the latter it became necessary to take steps of effect it. The British behaved very kindly to the brethren and offered to purchase the houses and cottages but their defeat prevented it. On entering the place the Americans first pretended to be friendly and sorry that the Indians had fled who had gone with Mr and Mrs Denke (one of the Missionaries) up the river. Mr and Mrs Schnall and the aged Missionary Michael Young remained.During the first night the Americans already changed their tone or rather showed their real character. They began to abuse the Missionaries with curses and all manner of insults plundering the houses ; and General Harrison to whom we appealed would grant no redress. They took every thing that was exable[?] away ; and under a pretence that King's stores and English goods were lodged in the houses ransacked every place and every trunk and chest belonging to individuals. Commodore Perry who had defeated the Mosquito fleet on the lake was there and behaved rather better than the rest advicing the Missionaries to get away as fast as they could.

The good understanding between the natives and our settlers which had been maintained for the last six years has given place to frequent outrages attended with fatal consequences. On Saturday a body of 60 natives commenced plundering the fields of a settler when three privates of the veteran battalion fired upon them and killed a boy.

The commercial world is flourishing here but in political matters I am sorry to say we are sadly in the back ground. The old defensive system is still adhered to and I fear much with all our reinforcements we shall do little good till we have another commander in chief. There is now a great body of regular troops in this country and a handful of brave fellows have recently been almost sacrificed par la petite guerre at Chippawa whilst in the lower province there are at least 10000 regulars doing nothing.Some of the officers of the regiments lately arrived from France do not conceal their sentiments– On inspecting one of the regiments the other day our chief took occasion as usual to make some remarks on the cut of the men's clothes when the Colonel commanding stepped forward and told him plainly that such systems were now completely exploded–that he had had the honour of serving very lately under a much more celebratedGeneral that it was probable he would ever serve under again–that his men had been accustomed to fight not to dance ; and if such was the plan he was called on to follow he should certainly retire from the service. Such language you may suppose was not very pleasing to our Governor ; but I am happy to find that we now have military men amongst us who are not afraid to speak out ; as it appears the numberless representations of civilians are not much attended to.Montreal July 14. I consider this country now as perfectly secure against any attempts that the Americans may make not withstanding the system of our chief does not seem to be changed. He has received a great many more troops this year than he had any idea of and does not seem pleased at having so large a force unhis command as the country will now look to him for some offensive operation against the enemy. He has done nothing the whole summer but parade about 6000 men at Chambly where he makes them march past him twice a-week bowing and scraping instead of emplying them where they ought to be.You will have heard of an American army of about 6000 under General Jacob Brown having crossed the river at Fort Erie when General Rial with a force of 1500 only gallantly assailed them but was overpowered by numbers and sustained considerable loss. I inclose a general order published yesterday about this unfortunate business whereby you will find that our loss has been great.Upon this frontier the Americans have hardly any force and it appears very singular indeed that so great a body of men as are now on the other side of the river from Sorel to Isle Aux Noix at least 10000 men should be left for the purpose of parade when they are so much wanted in the upper province.I sincerely hope that some investigation will take place into this business as it is really disgraceful to think that such an enemy should be able to make an attack upon us with impunity.,

The attack was made in three columns under Colonel Scott of the 103d regiment Lieutenant Colonel Drummond 104th regiment and Lieutenant Colonel Fischer of de Watteville's. The two former were directed to scale the fort and the latter to get possession of a small hill named Snake-Hill which the Americans had fortified and being situated only about eight hundred yards from Fort Erie was of consequence to us. This latter column failed in their object ; but the two columns destined for the fort carried the same in a most gallant manner and obliged the enemy to retire into two stone block-houses inside the fort when their own guns were turned against them. At this time a most unfortunate explosion took place which blew up the magazine and battery and with them a number of our brave soldiers ; and the consternation caused by this was so great and we were obliged to abandon our conquest and retreat to our original position with great loss of both officers and men.The large ship-building by the British at Kingston on Lake Ontario is to be launched the second week in September– also will carry about 100 guns.The battalion of royal marines commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Williams and which has been stationed lately at Isle au Noix and parts adjacent have been broken up and distributed among the fleets on the Lakes.

On the 1st inst. the advance was at Chazy.Quebec Sept. 8. From the north-western frontier of Upper Canada Messrs M'Gillivray and M'Leod who arrived here on Thursday last have brought dispatches from Lieutenant Colonel M'Donal at Michillimackinac written since the repulse of the American forces sent there to recapture it. The following are the particulars of that expedition :–On the forenoon of the 5th of August the Americans landed 900 men or thereabouts at the back of the island (Dowsman's farm). There is a considerable space of ground cleared and a gentle slope which enabled their vessels at anchor close to the beach to keep clear by a constant fire of grape &c. and which by the situation of the ground passed directly over the men's heads as they formed and advanced towards the woods.Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual[?] formed his small garrison (150 at most) at the extremity of the woods and the Indians were stationed on each flank to keep the enemy from outflanking the troops. By a false account of the enemy's intention to land on another part of the island a certain number of Indians were sent to watch their motions ; but more Indians absenting themselves exposed one flank of Lieutenant-Colonnel M'Doual's party entirely ; and an apprehension was entertained that the enemy would outflank and cut off the garrison from the forts ; it was therefore deemed expedient to fall back between the two forts and there await the advance of the enemy.A party of between 40 and 50 Indians placed on the left flank and ignorant of the movements in the centre and right flank fired on the Americans and threw them into confusion which the Indians soon perceived and encouraging each other by whoops and yells totally broke the little order still observed by the enemy who took instant flight and were all out of reach before Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual was apprised of their retreat.Thus was a body of at least from six to nine hundred men defeated and put to instant flight by 40 or 50 Indians with a loss of 17 men and a Major (Holmes) killed and found on the spot!–The Indians lost but one man.Previous to and combined with this the measures taken by the enemy were these:On the [?] of July a detachment of the expedition sent against Michillimackinac by the enemy proceeded to St Mary's where they met with no resistance there being neither troops nor Indians and every person occupied about their usual concerns ; such as bay making fishing &c. Major Holmes commanded the party who gave up to indiscriminate plunder and destroyed the whole of the property belonging to the North West Company ; burning their houses stores and vessels killing their cattle and taking off their engagees prisoners ; tearing down the fences destroying the gardens fields &c. Many wanton acts of cruelty might be detailed. Let two suffice for the present.Mr Johnstone's property was plundered even his furniture ; the very clothing of his wife and children was seized upon by these ruthless plunderers and carried away. Major Holmes sent to the south side of the strait for Mr Johnstone's son George and after threatening and reviling him with the most oppobrious language flourished his sword over his head and said he had a great mind to cut his head off now he was his slave When they were in the act of burning the houses and stores Mr G. Johnstone was ordered to stand in a certain spot under pain of being shot ; but had he remained sufforation[?] must have been his fate being so near the buildings in flames : he therefore risked being shot and came off and thereby effected a timely escape.Another instance of more than savage cruelty was exercised on a poor horse which they made us of all day in carting their plunder and in the evening whilst still tackled to the cart tied him to the end of the dwelling-house then in flames and amused themselves in looking at the poor animal making vain efforts to get loose ; but there he was burnt and his bones seen there by the writer of this.,
ID116,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1814,12,08,inform,Canada PapersMontreal Oct. 29 The express from Upper Canada which arrived yesterday morning confirmed the highly satisfactory reports of the preceding day that the enemy had precipitately retreated on the 19th instant from before Chippawa after destroying a quantity of provisions and heavy baggage ; and that on the 21st they had passed over to Buffaloe a great part of their force and were blowing up the works at Fort Erie.Further accounts from Kingston have been received this morning to the 26th instant when the official report of the enemy's retreat from Fort Erie after the destruction of the works had not reached that place but there was no doubt of the fact.Major-Genera de Watteville commanded the corps pressing on the enemy ; the master of a mail which arrived at Kingston on the 25th in twenty-four hours from Fort George further confirms the previous intelligence and reports that several hundred prisoners were taken before the Americans effected their escape across the river.On the 18th the British came up with his rear guard and in a sharp action thirty of the Americans were left on the field wihtout a casualty happening on our side. This was at Chippawa Creek.– The enemy then fled with the utmost precipitation to Fort Erie and began the destruction of his fortifications.A military courier from Kingston arrived this morning brings no additional news of importance.– Sir James Yeo had returned to Kingston with the sick of the army of Niagara on board. We again sailed for the head of the Lake.A private letter from Niagara of the 10th instant says that a severe action took place the day before near Chippawa ; our loss is stated at 10 killed and wounded. That of the enemy is supposed to be very considerable ; a field piece made to bear upon one of his columns did great execution. Another letter denies any loss in killed but makes the wounded 25 or 30.Montreal Nov. 5. From Upper Canada we have received nothing of importance. The report of the whole American armies have crossed the Niagara was a mistake as the last accounts from that quarter mention that General Brown was still in possession of Fort Erie.Quebec Nov. 3. We are in expectation of some further details of the operations on the Niagara frontier by this day's Montreal post ; but they had no arrived at one o'clock.The evacuation by the enemy of our territory on that frontier is a striking illustration of the importance of the command of the lake. The enemy did cross over to our side till the moment his fleet was ready to assume the superiority. The re-appearance of our fleet effected what could not be done by the expence of so much blood and treasure.(From the Quebec Gazette) The American Government has published the pa pers relating to the late negotations at Ghent. We confess that we have seen these papers with feelings of some satisfaction and much regret ; satisfaction that we can now say that the honour of the British Government is pledged to do something for British interests in North American and regret that that something is so little.The Indians are to be made independent of both nations. This is perfectly just and would under certain cirumstances greatly add to the security of these provinces. The Lakes are to be exclusively British. On these subjects we must be permitted to ask how long they would be permitted to remain so how long the Indians would retain their independence in the event of another war if the communication with them should be in the power of the enemy ? The sole communication for military purposes with the Indians and the Lakes is by the river St Lawrence from Montreal to Kingston and from Niagara to Fort Erie ; and the Americans are to be permitted to remain in possession of one of its banks ! The enemy has hitherto been prevented from interrupting this communication by the thinness of the settlements of their side the consequent badness of the roads and difficulty of supplying a large force. The possession of th southern bank of the St Lawrence between Montreal and Kingson and the power of supplying themselves and operating on that frontier by the roads now existing and from Lake Champlain has been worth a large force to them during the whole of the war ; it has caused us to parcel our force to support the line of communication between Lake St Francis and Kingston and keep a great proportion of it to protect the base of that line in the vicinity of Montreal.The position of Canada relative to the United States with its present boundaries is an extraordinary one ; so much so that intelligent military men have pronounced it incapable of defence much beyond Quebec. The miserable state of the enemy's preparations the superiority which we then had on the Lakes the good disposition of the inhabitants and the prudent conduct of the commander of the forces alone saved it. The waste of means in protecting and conveying supplies by a communication of fivehundred miles adjoining the whole way to the enemy's frontie is conceivable only to those whom experience has made acquainted with the fact or who are habituated to reflection ; and whenever the communication of the Lakes becomes interrupted the supply of any force further advanced on the line becomes utterly impracticable. The enemy derives his supplies either by the Lakes upon which an army can effect nothing or from a settled country a long way in his rear protected by his army a country covered with woods and a militia more effective than the best troops in such a country always ready for the protection of their property and their houses– Under such circumstances the weakness of an army beyond a certain point is to be counted by its numbers.We scruple not to say that whenever that part of the State of New York extending to the St Lawrence between Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain shall be fully settled the whole of Upper Canada must fall to the United States the Lower Canada will not be defensible but at an expence of means far beyond its value. We had much rather see the Americans confirmed in the possession of Sackett's Harbour Presqu-ile Detroit and Michilimackinac than in the possession of the tract of country just mentioned. Great Britain will always have the means of establishing a superiority on the Lakes whenever she chuses to exert them but she never will be able to drive the Americans out of that frontier when once fully settled supported as they will be by the immense population of the back parts of the State of New York and adjoining States.From the United States Papers Urbanna Sept. 25. An express has arrived from Detroit to General M'Arthur in six days in which Governor Cass says– A state of things has arrived in which your presence with the force at your disposal is essential to the security and preservation of the country. The Indians have recommenced hostilities on every side of us ; they are murdering the people and breaking up the settlements. There is now a large force of them in the immediate vicinity of this place most probably within a mile of it with the avowed purpose of attacking the town. We have no force adequate to the defence of the country and none of description proper for the pursuit of the Indians– My opinion is that you should hasten on with the mounted men with all possible expedition.The express came by water the land communiation being entirely cut off.Albany Oct. 25. The Legislature of this State adjourned yesterday after a session of four weeks. The principal laws passed are:An act to authorise the raising of troops for the defence of this State.

An act authorising additional pay to be made to the volunteers and for paying the militia called into service by the State authority. An act to aid in the apprehension of deserters from the army and navy of the United States.The first act authorises the Governor to call into actual service 12000 men for the term of two years provided the Government of the United States shall have declared their intention to pay clothe and subsist them at their expence.The privateer bill authorises associations to incorporate themselves for the purpose of fitting out privateers.The following resolution introduced by Mr Monell passed both Houses of our Legislature unanimously on Saturday:–Resolved unanimously–That the House of Assembly of the State of New York view with mingled emotions of surprise and indignation the extravagant and disgraceful terms proposed by the British Commissioners at Ghent–that however ardently they may desire the restoration of peace to their country they can never consent to receive it at the sacrifice of national honour and dignity–that they therefore strongly recommend to the National Legislature the adoption of the vigorous and efficacious measures in the prosecution of the war as the best means of the bringing the contest to an honourable termination and of transmitting unimpaired to their posterity their rights liberty and independence.The following is a private letter which was brought by the Liffey :Montreal Nov. 5. 1814. Sir George Prevost reached Kingston on the 10th October where his presence has been of the utmost importance. Chauncey resigned his blockade of that place on the 8th and retired with his squadron to Sackett's Harbour. Our fleet which was ready for the Lake in a few days after Sir George's arrival sailed for Niagara on the 16th with 500 of the 90th and a supply of provisions and stores for the right division and arrived off Fort George on the evening of the 18th. Having landed this reinforce ment Sir James returned to Kingston on the 24th.The enemy at Fort Erie having been joined by General Izard's army making a force of 7 or 8000 men advanced upon General Drummond and attacked our positions upon the Chippawa on the 15th instant ; but having met with an opposition unexpected by them and making no impression retired on the 16th and 17th to Black Creek from whence they advanced one of Izard's brigades 1500 men on the 19th with a view of our turning our right and attempted to cross the Chippawa about six miles from its mouth where they were met with by a corps of about 1000 troops under Colonel Meyers who faced them most manfully ; they skirmished the whole day in which the Glengarries supported their high character and in the evening Jonathan finding himself foiled and unable to bring up his artillery from the horrid state of the roads retired again to the main body at Black Creek.Our casualties on this occasion were triflin– those of the enemy were said to have been considerable though he refrained from exposing himself to our fire in the open ground. We had two field-pieces there and whenever the enemy showed a column out of the wood a well-directed discharge soon obliged them to return to their shelter. By this time our fleet being announced gave alarm to the enemy and they commenced a precipitate retreat to Fort Erie.They were purused on the 20th and 21st by our advance under Major-General Watteville close to Fort Erie where he found them occupying the high ground which General Drummond had not left many weeks before and could push no further. At the date of the last accounts from General Drummond Jonathan still maintained his post from which it will require a few columns of fresh troops to dislodge him but as they are now on their way to join the right dividion I trust I shall in a short time have the pleasure to acquaint you of the complete expulsion of the enemy from the Niagara frontier. It is said that for want of sufficient shelter a part of General Izard's force had crossed to Buffalo and that they had passed over some heavy artillery and stores leaving at the fort such a force as they conceived capable of defending it.Sir James brough down with him the skeleton of the 1st battalion of the King's regiment and theremains of the two flank companies of the 10th. He sailed again on the 1st inst. taking with him about 1200 men comprising the 37th a brigade of artillery a 9pounder and detachments from the 6th and 82d regiments and a large supply of provisions and stores. The five hundred of the 9th regiment who marched to York would be crossed to Niagara in the brigs ; the 9th 850 strong were to have been embarked in the fleet but Sir James could not take them. The Royals 41st 89th and 100th exhausted corps return to Kingston by this trip of the fleet which I fear was scarcely able to make another this season. The St Lawrence has proved a noble ship and one and all seem delighted with her. The frigate in frame arrived at Kingston where she has been laid down and lengthened to make her the size of the Prince Regent. The keel of a 74 is also laid down there. The Americans are said to have commenced upon two more ships of the class of the Superior. Letters from Michilimacinack to the 19th October state that the capture of the two schooners will be attended with the most important benefits in the security of that post and the territory dependent upon it. Captain Rocheblave with the detachment of the 81st under Capt. Wardrop and artillery arrived there on the 14th October without any casualty among the troops ; and Mr M'Kenzie with his brigade would arrive about the 21st. The two schooners had made a trip to Nottawasage for provisions and supplies and would attempt another before the navigation closed. A reinforcement had been sent under Capt Bulgar to Praire du Chain.The arrangements necessary for reinforcing and supplying General Drummond's army being completed and the attack upon Sackett's Harbour being deemed impracticable this season Sir George returned last evening to this place ; his journey to Kingston has certainly had the effect of inducing General Brown with a considerable part of his force to move to Sackett's Harbour and has thus left General Izard so much weakened at Fort Erie that I have little doubt of the result of an attack upon him.I am sorry to see that the malice of a certain party here has been at work at your side of the water ; it has increased tenfold since the expression of the public sentiment in favour of his Excellency by the addresses which are now preparing and which I can assure you is the real and unsolicited voice of the people. I am happy to find that General Kempt is going to England as he will afford true information upon the state of the country and be able to exposethe falsehoods which have been circulated respecting recent events.,
ID117,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1816,01,15,inform,New South WalesA journey into the interior of New South Wales across the Blue Mountains performed by his Excellency Colonel Mac quarrie Governor of the settlement. From the official account dated Sydney June 10. 1815.The Governor desires to communicate for the information of the public the result of his late tour over the Western or Blue Mountains undertaken for the purpose of being enabled personally to appreciate the importance of the track of country lying westward of them which had been explored in the latter end of the year 1813 and beginning of 1814 by Mr George William Evans Deputy Surveyor of Lands.To those who know how very limited a track of country has been hitherto occupied by the colonists of New South Walves extending along the eastern coast to the north and south of Port Jackson only 80 miles and westward about 40 miles to the foot of that chain of mountains in the interior which forms its western boundary it must be a subject of astonishment and regret that amongst so large a population no one appeared within the first twenty-five years of the establishment of this settlement possessed of sufficient energy of mind to induce him fully to explore a passage over these mountains ; but when it is considered that for the greater part of that time even this circumscribed portion of country afforded sufficient produce for the wants of the people whilst on the other hand the whole surface of the country beyond those limits was a thick and in many places nearly an impenetrable forest the surprise at the want of effort to surmount such difficulties must abate very considerably.The records of the colony only afford two instances of any bold attempt having been made to discover the country to the westward of the Blue Mountains. The first was by Mr Bass and the other by Mr Caley and both ended in disappointment; a cirumstance which will not be much wondered at by those who have lately crossed these mountains.To Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth Esqrs. and Liutenant Lawson of the Royal veteran company the merit is due of having with extraordinary patience and much fatigu effected the first passage over the most rugged and difficult part of the Blue Mountains.The Governor being strongly impressed with the importance of the object had early after his arrival in this colony formed the resolution of encouraging the attempt to find a passage to the western country and willingly availed himself of the facilities which the discoveries of these three gentlemen afforded him. Accordingly on the 20th of November 1813 he entrusted the accomplishment of this object to Mr George William Evans deputy surveyor of lands the result of whose journey was laid before the public through the medium of the Sydney Gazette on the 12th of February 1814.The favourable account given by Mr Evans of the country he had explored induced the Governor to cause a road to be constructed for the passage and conveyance of cattle and provisions to the interior ; and men of good character from amongst a number of convicts who had volunteered their services were selected to perform this arduous work on condition of being fed and clothed during the continuance of their labour and being granted emancipations as their final reward on the completion of the work.The direction and superintendence of this great work was entrusted to William Cox. Esq. the chief magistrate at Windsor ; and to the astonishment of every one who knows what was to be encountered and sees what has been done he effected its completion in six months from the time of its commencement happily without the loss of a man or any serious accident. The Governor is at a loss to appreciate fully the services rendered by Mr Cox to this colony in the execution of this arduous work which promises to be of the greatest public utility by opening a new source of wealth to the industrious and enterprising. When it is considered that Mr Cox voluntarily relinquished the comforts of his own house and the society of his numerous family and exposed himself to much personal fatigue with only such temporary covering as the bark hut could afford from the inclemency of the season it is difficult to express the sentiments of approbation to which such privations and services are entitled.Mr Cox having reported the road as completed on the 21st of January the Governor accompanied by Mrs Macquarrie and that gentleman commenced his tour on the 25th of April last over the Blue Mountains and was joined by Sir John Jamieson at the Nepean who accompanied him during the entire tour. The following gentlemen composed the Governor's suite: Mr Campbell Secretary ; Captain Antill Major of Brigade ; Lieutenant Watts Aide de camp ; Mr Redfern Assistant-Surgeon ; Mr Oxley Surveyor-General ; Mr Mehan Deputy Surveyor-General ; Mr Lewin Painter and Naturalist ; and Mr G. Evans Deputy Surveyor of lands who had been sent forward for the purpose of making further discoveries and rejoined the party on the day of arrival at Bathurst Plains.The commencement of the ascent from Emu Plains to the first depot and thence to a resting place now called Spring Wood distant twelve miles from Emu Ford was through a very handsome open forests of lofty trees and much more practicable and easy than was expected. The facility of the ascent for this distance excited surprise and is certainly not well calculated to give the traveller a just idea of the difficulties he has afterwards to encounter. At a further disstance of four miles a sudden change is perceived in the appearance of the timber and the quality of the soil the former becoming stunted and the latter barren and rocky. At this place the fatigues of the journey may be said to commence. Here the country became altogether mountainous and extremely rugged. Near to the 18th mile (it is to be observed that the measure commences at Emu Ford) a pile of stones attracted attention. It is close to the line of road on the top of a rugged and abrupt ascent and is supposed to have been placed there by Mr Caley as the extreme limit of his tour. Hence the Governor gave that part of the mountain the name as Caley's[?] Repulse. To have penetrated even so far was at that time an effort of no small difficulty. From henceforward to the 26th mile is a succession of steep and rugged hills some of which are almost so abrupt as to deny a passage altogether ; but at this place a considerable extensive plain is arrived at which constitutes the summit of the western mountains ; and from thence a most extensive and beautiful prospect presents itself on all sides to the eye. The town of Windsor the river Hawkesbury Prospect Hill and other objects within that part of the colony now inhabited of equal interest are distinctly seen from hence. The majestic grandeur of the situation combined with the various objects to be seen from this place induced the Governor to give it the appellation of the King's Table Land. On the south-west side of the King's Table Land the mountain terminates in abrupt precipices of immense depth at the bottom of which is seen a glen as romantically beautiful as can be imagined bounded on the further side by mountains of great magnitude terminating equally abruptly as the others and the whole thickly covered with wood. The length of this picturesque and remarkable track of country is about 24 miles to which the Governor gave the name of the Prince Regent's Glen. Proceeding hence to the thirty-third mile on the top of a hill an opening presents itself on the south-west side of the Prince Regent's Glen from whence a view is obtained particularly beautiful and grand–mountains rising beyond mountains with stupendous masses of rock in the fore ground here strike the eye with admiration and astonishment. The circular form in which the whole is so wonderfully disposed induced the Governor to give the name of Pitt's Amphitheatre (in honour of the Right Hon. William Pitt) to this offset of branch from the Prince Regent's Glen. The road continues from hence for the space of 17 miles on the ridge of the mountain which forms one side of the Prince Regent's Glen and there it suddenly terminates in nearly a perpendicular precipice of 676 feet high as ascertained by measurement. The road constructed by Mr Cox down this rugged and tremendous descent through all its windings is no less than three-fourths of a mile in length and has been executed with such skill and stability as reflects much credit on him. The labour here undergone and the difficulties surmounted can only be appreciated by those who view this scene. In order to perpetuate the memory of Mr Cox's services the Governor deemed it a tribute justly due to him to give his name to this grand and extraordinary pass and he accordingly called it Cox's Pass. Having descended into a valley at the bottom of this pass the retrospective view of the overhanging mountain is magnificently grand. Although the present pass is the only practicable point yet discovered for descending by yet the mountain is much higher than those on either side of it from whence it is distinguished at a considerable distance when approaching it from the interior and in this point of view it has the appearance of a very high distinct hill although it is in fact only the abrupt termination of a ridge. The Governor gave the name of Mount York to this termination of the ridge in honour of his Royal Highness the Duke of York.On descending Cox' Pass the Governor was much gratified by the appearance of good pasture land and soil fit for cultivation which was the first he had met with since the commencement of his tour. The valley at the base of Mount York he called the Vale of Clwyd in consequence of the strong resemblance it bore to the vale of that name in North Wales. The grass in this vale is of a good quality and very [?]dant and a rivulet of fine water runs along it from the eastward which unites itself at the western extremity of the vale with another rivulet containing still more water. The junction of these two streams forms a very handsome river now called by the Governor Cox's River which takes its course as has been since ascertained through the Prince Regent's Glen and empties itself into the river Nepean ; and it is conjectured from the nature of the country through which it passes that it mut be one of the principal causes of the floods which have been occasionally felt on the low banks of the river Hawkesbury into which the Nepean discharges itself. The Vale of Clwyd from the base of Mount York extends six miles in a westerly direction and has its termination at Cox's River. Westward of this river the country again becomes hilly but it is generally open forest land and very good passage.Three miles to the westward of the Vale of Clwyd Messrs Blaxland Wentworth and Lawson had formerly terminated their excursion ; and when the various difficulties are considered which they had to contend with especially until they had effected the descent from Mount York to which place they were obliged to pass through a thick brush-wood where they were under the necessity of cutting a passage for their baggage horses the severity of which labour had seriously affected their healths their patient endurance of such fatigue cannot fail to excite much surprise and admiration. In commemoration of their merits three beautiful high hills joining each other at the end of their tour at this place have receieved their names in the following order viz. Mount Blaxland Wentworth's Sugar Loaf and Lawson's Sugar Load. A range of very lofty hills and narrow vallies alternately form the track of country from Cox's River for a distance of 16 miles until the Fish River is arrived at ; and the stage between these rivers is consequently very severe and oppressive on the cattle. To this range the Governor gave the name of Clarence Hilly Range.Proceeding from the Fish River and at a short distance from it a very singular and beautiful mountain attracts the attentions its summit being crowned with a large and very extraordinary looking rock nearly circular in form which gives the whole very much the appearance of a hill fort such as are frequent in India. To this lofty hill Mr Evans who was the first European discoverer gave the name of Mount Evans. Passing on from hence the country continues hilly but affords good pasturage gradually improving to Sidmouth Valley which is distant from the pass of the Fish RIver eight miles. The land here is level and the first met with unencumbered with timber. It is not of very considerable extent but abounds with a great variety of herbs and plants such as would probably highly interest and gratify the scientific botanist. The beautiful little valley runs northwest and south-east between hills of easy ascent thinly covered with timber. Leaving Sidmouth Valley the country becomes again hilly and in other respects resembles very much the country to the eastward of the valley for some miles. Having reached Campbell River distant 13 miles from Sidmouth Valley the Governor was highly gratified by the appearance of the country which there began to exhibity an open and extensive view of gently rising grounds and fertile plains. Judging from the height of the banks and its general width the Campbell River must be on some occasions of very considerable magnitude ; but the extraordinary drought which has apparently prevailed on the western side of the mountains equally as throughout this colony for the last three years has reduced this river so much that it may be more properly called a chain of pools than a running stream at the present time. In the reaches or pools of the Campbell River the very curious animal called the Paradox or Water Mole is seen in great numbers. The soil on both banks is uncommonly rich and the grass is consequently luxuriant. Two miles to the southward of the line of road which crosses the Campbell River there is a very fine rich track of low lands which has been named Mitchell Plains. Flax was found here growing in considerable quanities. The Fish River which forms a junction with the Campbell River a few miles to the northward of the road and bridge over the latter has also two very fertile plains on its banks the one called O'Connel Plains and the other Macquarrie Plains both of considerable extent and very capable of yielding all the necessities of life.At the distance of seven miles from the bridge over the Campbell River Bathurst Plains open to the view presenting a rich track of champaign country of 11 miles in length bounded on both sides by gently rising and very beautiful hills thinly wooded. The Macquarrie River which is constituted by the junction of the Fish and Campbell River takes a winding course through the Plains which can be easily traced from the high lands ajoining by the particular verdure of the trees on its banks which are likewise the only trees throughout the extent of the plains. The level and clean surface of these plains gives them at first view very much the appearance of lands in a state of cultivation.It is impossible to behold this grand scene without a feeling of admiration and surprise whilst the silence and solitude which reign in a space of such extent and beauty as seems designed by Nature for the occupancy and comfort of man created a degree of melancholy in the mind which may be more easily imagined than described.The Governor and suite arrived at these Plains on Thursday the 4th of May and encamped on the southern or left bank of the Macquarrie River–the situation being selected in consequence of its commanding a beautiful and extensive prospect for many miles in every direction around it. At this place the Governor remained for a week which time he occupied in making excursions in different directions through the adjoining country on both sides the river.On Sunday the 7th of May the Governor fixed on a site suitable for the erection of a town at some future period to which he gave the name of Bathurst in honour of the present Secretary of State for the Colonies. The situation of Bathurst is elevated sufficiently beyond the reach of any floods which may occur and is at the same time so near to the river on its south bank as to derive all the advantages of its clear and beautiful stream. The mechanics and settlers of whatever description who may be hereafter permitted to form permanent residences to themselves at this place will have the highly important advantages of a rich and fertile soil with a beautiful river flowing through it for all the uses of man. The Governor mut however add that the hopes which were once so sanguinely entertained of this river becoming navigable to the Western Sea have ended in disappointment.During the week that the Governor remained at Bathurst he made daily excursions in various directions ; one of these extended 22 miles in a south-west direction and on that occasion as well as on all the others he found the country chiefly composed of vallies and plains separated occasionally by ranges of low hills; the soil throughout being generally fertile and well circumstanced for the purpose of agriculture or grazing.The Governor here feels much pleasure in being enabled to communicate to the public that the favourable reports which he had received of the country to the west of the Blue Mountains have not been by any means exaggerated. The difficulties which present themselves in the journey from hence are certainly great and inevitable but thsoe persons who may be inclined to become permanent settlers there will probably content themselves withvisiting this part of the colony but rarely and of course will have them seldom to encounter. Plenty of water and a sufficiency of grass are to be found in the mountains for the support of such cattle as may be sent over them ; and the tracks of fertile soil and rich pasturage which the new country affords are fully extensive enough for any increase of population and stock which can possibly take place for many years.Within a distance of ten miles from the site of Bathurst there is not less than 50000 acres of land clear of timber and fully one half of that may be considered excellent soil well calculated for cultivation. It is a matter of regrets that in proportion as the soil improves the timber degenerates ; and it is to be remarked that everywhere to the westward of the mountains it is much inferior both in size and quality to that within the present colony ; there is however a sufficiency of timber of tolerable quality within the district around Bathurst for the purposes of house-building and husbandry.The Governor has here to lament that neither coals nor limestone have been yet discovered in the western country ; articles in themselves of so much importance that the want of them must be severely felt whenever that country shall be settled.Having enumerated the principal and most important features of this new country the Governor has now to notice some of its live productions. All around Bathurst abounds in a variety of game ; and the two principal rivers contain a great quantity of fish but all of one denomination resembling the perch in appearance and of a delicate and fine flavour not unlike that of a rock cod. This fish grows to a large size and is very voracious. Several of them were caught during the Governor's stay at Bathurst and at the halting place on the Fish River. One of those caught weight 17 lb ; and the people stationed at Bathurst stated that they had caught some weighing 25 lb.The field game are the kangaroos emus black swans wild geese wild turkies bustards ducks of various kinds quail bronze and other pigeons &c. &c. The water mole or paradox also abounds in all the rivers and ponds.The site designed for the towns of Bathurst by observation taken at the Flag Staff which was erected on the day of Bathurst receiving that name is situated in latitude 33. 24. 30. south being also 27 1/2 miles north of Government House In Sydney and 94 1/2 west of it bearing west 20. 30. north 83 geographic miles or 95 1/2 statute miles ; the measured road distance from Sydney to Bathurst being 140 English miles.The road constructed by Mr Cox and the party under him commences at Emu Ford on the left bank of the river Nepean and is thence carried 101 1/2 miles to the flag staff at Bathurst. This road has been carefully measured and each mile regularly marked on the trees growing on the left side of the road proceeding towards Bathurst.The Governor in his tour made the following stages in which he was principally regulated by the consideration of having good pasturage for the cattle and plenty of water :–1st stage–Spring Wood distant from Emu Ford 12 miles 2d stage ditto–Jamieson's Valley or 2d depot distant from ditto . . . . . . . . . . 28 3d ditto–Blackheath distant from ditto . . . 41 4th ditto–Cox's River distant from ditto . . .56 5th ditto–The Fish River distant from ditto . 72 6th ditto–Sidmouth Valley distant from ditto . 80 7th ditto–Campbell River distant from ditto . 91 8th ditto–Bathurst distant from ditto . . . 101 1/2At all of which places the traveller may assure himself of good grass and water in abundance.On Thursday the 11th of May the Governor and suite set out from Bathurst on their return and arrived at Sidney on Friday the 19th Ult.The Governor deems it expedient here to notify to the public that he does not mean to make any grants of land to the westward of the Blue Mountains until he shall receive the commands of his Majesty's Ministers on that subject and in reply to the report he is now about to make them upon it.In the mean time such gentlemen or other respectable free persons as may wish to visit this new country will be permitted to do so on making a written application to the Governor to that effect who will order them to be furnished with written passes. It is at the same time strictly ordered and directed that no person whether civil or military shall attempt to travel over the Blue Mountains without having previously applied for and obtained permission in the above prescribed form. The military guard stationed at the first depot on the mountains will receive full instructions to prevent the progress of any persons who shall not have obtained regular passes. The necessity for the establishing and strictly enforcing this regulation is too obvious to every one who will reflect on it to require any explanation here.The Governor cannot conclude this account of his tour without offering his best ackowledgements to William Cox Esq. for the important services he has rendered to the colony in so short a period of time by opening a passage to the new discovered country and at the same time assuring him that he shall have great pleasure in recommending his meritorious services on this occasion to the favourable consideration of his Majesty's Ministers.,

On the afternoon of Saturday last the specie seized on board the Lake Champlain steam-boat amounting to upward of 12000 dollars arrived at his Majesty's cash-office here under the escort of the 19th light dragoons from St John's.At length we have authentic accounts relating to the expedition of Lord Selkirk ; they are very important as many ex parte details have been published - his taking Fort William by storm making all the partners of the North West Company prisoners &c. ; but the cause of the expe dition has never been explained. The Canadian Courant puts it in a very clear point of view:– Mr Robert Semple the Governor-General The Hudson's Bay Company on the Red River towards the close of the year 1815 took possession of two establishments belonging to the North West Company which had obtruded themselves on the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company. The North West traders then altered their route going into the Upper Country by circuitous ways by which much delay took place ; and in order to try Mr Semple they sent two cartloads of provisions by the former track in June last with a guard of fifty men ; the advance twenty-two of the number fell in with one of the natives whom they took forward with them to prevent discovery. The rear-guard passed within four miles of the settlement ; they were perceived by the Governor and were attacked by a party from the garrison consisting of about thirty soldiers ; an engagement took place stated on the 19th of June. Mr Semple and 21 of his men were killed ; the rest of his forces returned defeated to the fort ; it is on this account that the expedition of Lord Selkirk was undertaken. The manner of Lord Selkirk's conducting the expedition we do not justify nor indeed can we form any opinion on the subject without further authentic details ; it is however but justice to say that the Hudson's Bay Company have rights and are a chartered Company ; the North West Traders though we believe a most respectable body are only an Association of Merchants.,
ID120,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1816,12,16,inform,Canada Lord SelkirkWe have been favoured by a Gentleman in this city with the following interesting and authentic communication on the subject of the dispute between Lord Selkirk and the Gentlemen of the North West Company:Extract of a Letter from Montreal dated 6th October 1816.In the newspapers which I sent you you will see some accounts of the disturbances which have taken place in the North West between the North West Company and Lord Selkirk's colonists. The latter have been obliged to leave the Red River after having had 22 of their men including Governor Semple killed by a party of half-breeds the spurious offspring of the North West Company. As yet have not had an accurate statement of that melancholy transaction. Lord Selkirk's party state that these half-breed with some of the North West Com pany servants came to destroy the settlement and that Mr Semple with about 25 of the Colonists went out to meet them to know what could be their intentions when those rascals commenced firing on them and massacred all but three who were fortunate enough to make their escape. The North West people's account is that these half-breeds with some Indians were bringing down provisions from the upper part of the Red River to the entrance near Lake Winipie and as the Colonists had the command of a great part of the river they were obliged to pass in the rear of the settlement which being observed by Governor Semple who was on the look-out for them he settled out of his Fort with 25 men and a [?]-piece to take from the Indians the provisions which were intended for the North West Company ; that the result[?] was an engagement which terminated in the defeat of the Colonists of whom twenty-two were killed. Lord Selkirk [?] from Montreal for the Red River about the latter end of June when[?] three or four officers and about 150 men of De Men[?]'s regiment which had been disbanded and when he arrived at Fort William on Lake Superior hearing the fate of his Colonists he[?] immediately issued a warrant against Mr M'Gillivray for high treason conspiracy and murder and subsequently warrants against all the partners of the N. W. Company who were at F William [?] formal possession of their establishment there and sent Mr M'Gillivray with about ten others prisoners to Montreal with all their papers [?] a number of packs of Beaver and other Furs and several bales[?] of Merchandise which he found in possession of the North West Company belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company. The Police Officers in Montreal were several days examining the papers and about four or five days after the arrival of Mr M'Gillivray and the others they were admitted to bail to appear to take their trial at the next criminal court or any court of Oyer and Terminer which may be appointed. Stuart (the ci-de vant Solicitor-General who was dismissed by Sir James Craig and at whose instance an ineffectual attempt was lately made by some misguided members of our House of Assembly to impeach Chief Justices Sewell and Monk) is one of Lord Selkirk's counsel and spoke at great length and what his friends and admirers call very eloquently strongly opposed their being admitted to bail but all would not do and they were accordingly bailed ; Mr M'Gillivray in sureties of t1000 and the others in t500 sums inconsiderable enough advering to the high crimes and misdemeanours with which they were charged.In the Montreal Herald you will see a very learned and (as our neighbour Jonathan would say) a lengthy communication signed Montius[?] setting forth the rights which the Hudson's Bay Company by their charter possess over the Countries which they have granted to Lord Selkirk and the power vested in him of appointing Governors and other Officers to superintend and regulate the Colony. Being a masterly production it will no doubt makes its appearance in a pamphlet and when it does I shall send you one in case the papers should miscarry. It is uncertain whether the Earl will remain in the North West during the winter or come down to Montreal ; if the latter he must be down[?] soon[?] as the season for water-travelling will shortly close.Montreal is now divided into two parties one favouring the Lord and the other the North West Company ; and with the exception of the friends of the latter strongly in favour of his Lordship.,
ID121,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1817,07,21,entertain,Emigration to America.[ Extracted from No.15 of Cobbet's Register published on Saturday 12th instant ].Cobbett's arrival in America&c.On Wednesday evening the 27th March we embarked on board the Importer D. Ogden master bound to New York where we arrived on the 5th of May with about 40 steerage passengers farmers and tradesmen who were fleeing from ruin and starvation. In all respects that can be named our passage disagreeable and upon one occasion very perilous from lightning which struck the ship twice shivered two of the masts killed a man struck several people slightly between two of whom I was sitting without at all feeling the blow.Some of our fellow-passengers have found great disappointment ; and it is stated in some of the public papers here that many hundreds have during the last year accepted of the offer of our Consul at New York to go and settle in Canada. You know that I have never advised any body to emigrate. I have always said that it is no place for manufacturers ; no place for men to live without work ; no place for a farmer who does not work himself ; no place in short for any one who is not able and willing to work at the ordinary sorts of work ; but for such men there is every where a plentiful happy and easy life. None should come however who have any views of idleness ; and even for the industrious poor I see no reason why they should expend their last shilling and undergo all the miseries and dangers of a sea voyage in order to save those who eat the taxes the expence of their share of poor-rates ; a man and his wife and a child or two cannot come under the expence of 35 guineas at least. A single man 20 guineas before he gets into work again ; and as I always said I never would if I were in the place of such a man expend my earnings on a sea voyage and endure all its hardships in order to remove one eye sore out of the way of corruption. Besides there is the climate which is not so good as ours though it is not bad and people often live to an old age. The country is good but it will easily be conceived that new face an entire new scene a separation from every friend work done in a quite different way from it is in England ; it will easily be conceived that all this makes such a dislocation in a man's mind as to make him very unhappy for a while. Then he cannot expect to find work the first day. He must ask first at any rate. Englishmen are sheepish ; and they are sure to find rascals enough here to foster their disgust merely for the sake of serving the cause of corruption at home. In short I advice nobody to emigrate but I will truly describe the country and the people. As to emigrating with a view of settling and farming in the new countries it is neither more nor less than downright madness. It is what our English farmers know nothing at all about ; it is what they are not at all fit for ; and the far greater part of all such spe culations end in disappointment if not in ruin and premature death. I hope that our beloved country will shortly be fit for an honest and industrious man to live in ; but if any farmers come with money in their pockets my advice is not to give way either to enthusiastic admiration or to instant disgust. But to stop a little ; to look about them ; to see not only after good land but a good market for its products. The western romance writers tell us that the land in the Ohio is too good ; but Mr Mellish in his valuable book tells us that beef and pork sell for three halfpence a pound. An excellent country for people who want to do nothing but eat. – Give me Long Island where the land is not too good ; but where beef and pork sell for about eightpence a pound (I speak of English money); where good hay sells for five pounts a ton ; and where there is a ready market for every species of produce. One thing above all ; if an English farmer (I mean by English people of the whole of the United Kingdom) comes here with money in his pocket let him resolve to keep it there for a year and then he will be sure to do well. – All that I see around me here is well calculated to attract the attention and to please the sight of one like myself brought up in the country always greatly delighted with and somewhat skilled in various pleasing and healthful pursuits. The The people are engaged busily in planting their Indian corn. The cherry trees of which there are multitudes planted in long avenues or rows or round the fields have dropped their blossom and begin to show their loads of fruit. The apple and pear orchards in extent from one to twenty acres on each farm are in full and beautiful bloom. The farms are small in extent ; no appearance of want amongst the labourers who receive in the country about two shillings and threepence (our money) a-day with board and lodging and which board consists of plenty of excellent meat and fish of all sorts the best of bread butter cheese and eggs. That you may form some idea as to prices of living I will state a few facts which have already come within my own knowledge. We are at present at an inn thirteen miles from New York. It is on the road to that city. Scarcely an hour in the day passes without a carriage of some sort offering for going thither and to go by the regular stage costs three shillings. Mind I shall always speak in English money when I do not speak of dollars. We lodge and board in this inn have each a bed-room and good bed have a room to sit in ourselves ; we eat by ourselves ; and it really is eating. – We have smoked fish chops butter and eggs for breakfast with bread (the very finest I ever sa) crackers sweet cakes ; and when I say that we have such and such things I do not mean that we get them for show or just enough to smell to ; but in loads. Not an egg but a dish full of eggs. Not a snip of meat or of fish ; but a plateful. Lump sugar for our tea and coffee ; not broke into little bits the size of a hazle nut but in good thumping pieces. For dinner we have the finest of fish bass mackerel lobsters ; of meat lamb veal ham &c. ; asparagus in plenty ; apple pieces (through in the middle of May). The supper is like the breakfast with preserved peaches and other things. And with all this an excellent cyder to drink with the kindest and most obliging treatment on the part of the landlord and landlady and their sons and daughters we pay no more than 22s. 6d. a week each. In England the same food and drink and lodging at an inn would cost us nearly the same sum every day. But there are two things which no money can purchase any where. The first is no grumbling on the part of the landlady except on account of our eating and drinking too little ; and the other is that Mr Wiggins has no fastening but a bit of chip run in over the latch of the door to a house which is full of valuable things of all sorts and about which we leave all our things much more carelessly than we should do in our own house in any part of England. Here then are we able to live at an inn one of the most respectable in the whole country at the rate of fifty pounds a year while the pay of a common farming man is not much short of that sum.,
ID122,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,01,inform,EmigrationThe authenticity of the following details of the miseries endured by some German emigrants proceeding from Amsterdam to America is we are told guaranteed ; otherwise they are almost too shocking to admit to belief :Libson Nov. 4We have just been witnesses here of an event which has renewed those gloomy reflexions which the friends of humanity have indulged ever since the commencement of the emigration from Germany and Switzerland to America. We have deplored the error which led so great a number of unhappy persons to expartiate themselves in the hope of finding a happier lot upon the shores of the new world. But it is less to the blindness of the victims of this error than to the abominable speculations of cupidity that we are to attribute these numerous emigrations.the misery of the people of Germany and Switzerland occasioned by a superabundance of population and by the bad harvests of late years serves for aliment to the avarice of certain men who seek to establish criminal projects upon bases almost as obnoxious as those of the former slave trade. Such calculations deserve the attention of Governments and it is with this view that we think is our duty to make known the fate of an expedition of this kind fitted out at Amsterdam last August.But we shall first transcribe from the original the article of the charter party relative to the power reserved by the Captain over the persons of the passengers as inlcuding stipulations which are most characteristic of the nature of that odious traffic :–We passengers promise to fulfil faithfully the following conditions:– With respect to the price of the passage above stipulated for so much as we have not yet paid we engage to gain by our labour in America what we owe and we who owe the whole amount of our passage are bound if required and if we are unable to find better conditions to hire ourselves for four or five years in order to pay for our passage ; and we who have only paid for a part of our passage equally promise to let ourselves out to work for the same time for the sum we still owe.We promise besides we passengers men or women fathers or mothers children and families here assembled the children for their parents the parents for their children the brother for his brother and the sister for her sister when we shall find an opportunity to employ ourselves in America to engage ourselves in service and to answer for one for the other one for all the others whether he be of our family or not so that the price of the passage be diminished or augmented as much as shall be necessary until we all and our families have employment and the captain be no loser by us ; knowing very well that we passengers who have children a family brothers and sisters ought all to sumbit to our wives or husbands our children our brothers our sisters being sent separately to whatever place in order to gain in private service profession or labour or in any manner that shall be deemed best the price of our passage ; and in order that we may not in any case refused the engagements proposed to us or contract others without the permission not knowledge of the capain it is agreed for those who have not yet paid for their passage for those who still owe part and for those who cannot find an engagement that they must consent to me the captain carrying them to such place in America as it shall please me and wherever I may find it expedient to proceed or wherever it may suit me to sail.These horrible conditions were signed by 300 passengers. They had contracted with the Captain of a Dutch ship which was to proceed first to Baltimore. She in the worst state when she sailed from Amsterdam and in defiance of the clauses of the contract by which the Captain had engaged to feed them properly during the voyage he had not even embarked the necessary quanitity of provisions ; for after 62 days navigation the leaks had so gained upon the ship that she was in danger of sinking and famine had already made frightful ravages. It was at the end of that time and in this deplo rable condition that she was forced into Belem near Lisbon.Long before her arrival on our coasts the passengers had been reduced to the greatest misery not more by the small quantity than by the bad quality of the provisions. The water was gone and sea-water was their only drink. So much had they been wasted that forty had already died of famine. Among the rest there were a great many sick some of who have died since their arrival in Portugal.The situation of the vessel had at first given great alarm to our Council of Health who apprehensive of contagion were for an instant fearful that it would be necessary to force her out to sea. That would have been a misery so much the more formidable because the ship was not in a state to keep the sea and all must infallibly have perished. Happily this was deemed unnecessary and a quarantine was ordered. The Regency of Lisbon determined that provisions and other succours should be furnished at the expence of the State. All the Consuls were most active and benevolent in affording assistance.Such was the result of the expedition. Many others have no doubt answered as little the expectations of those who seduced by deceitful promises have emigrated to America in search of happiness which they could not find abandoning their country their parents and their friends. In July a Hamburgh ship with 106 Swiss passengers was at Lisbon in nearly the same distress with the Dutch ship. It is said here that there is a company in Holland which has numerous agents to seduce men to emigrate.

The only information I can yet give you is that the exploring survey has been extended from the source of the St Croix river to the river Restigouche in line about 100 miles ; in this short distance both parties experienced difficulties and sufferings of the severest nature. The Americans employed on the same line with our English Commissioners are represented as men of great ability and acting with that spirit of liberality that infuses confidence on each side rendering their arduous task less severe and gloomy than was to have been expected in thie untrodden wilds of this quarter. Our trade continues dull and money scarce. Government bills are 3 per cent advance but expected to be lower in consequence of the Commissary-General having refused to take the provincial notes.Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard–On Friday night about half-past nine o'clock this place was thrown into the greatest consternation by the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard the beating of drums and the firing of the men of war's guns. It was occasioned by a fire having broken out in the house belonging to the steam engine erected for carrying on the new works situated in the southern part of the dock- yard near the kilns used for burning cement stone. The most serious apprehensions were entertained for the safety of the arsenal ; and what was more distressing to the feelings of the spectators was its coniguity to the workhouse which from the pressure of the times and want of employment is crowded with many unfortunate individuals. Providence however averted the impending danger and about twelve o'clock we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames subdued with only the loss of the engine-house. No lives it is understood have been lost but one poor man is severely hurt. Captain Walker of the Northumberland and the officers of that ship Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter and Captain Brown and the officers of the Ordinary with the military officers and soldiers of the garrison assembled on the first alarm. The latter were under arms the whole time and were of great service in keeping off the spectators. The inhabitants of the twon were at one time under serious apprehensions as the fire was not far from the Fountain tavern and the residence of Mr Miller in High Street. At the former the landlady of the house had but recently lain in and was removed on the first alarm being given. Sir Robert Barlow from Chatham who superintends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle was here yesterday to investiage into the cause which it is suspected arose from carlessness – The damage however has not been so great as was at first expected and which it might have been but for the prompt and effectual assistance that was given – Sheerness January 11,

ID125,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,19,inform,Irish Emigrants. New York Nov. 27.Nothing scarcely can be conceived more distressing than the situation of an unfriended stranger arrived here from across the Atlantic without the means of helping himself and without even enough of acquaintance with the men and things about him to enable him to judge what path he should take to secure him the miseries of absolute want. Such however is actually the situation of hundres who annually land on our shores. To provide for those forlorn beings several attempts have been made by associations of humane individuals here but nothing hitherto has appeared to promising as that of which an account here follows: –At a meeting of Irishmen and descendents of Irishmen held at Harmony Hall on Tuesday the 25th instant for the purpose of promoting a Settlement of Irish Emigrants; Andrew Morris Chairman WM. Sampson Secretary ;Upon the motion of Thomas Addis Emmett the circular previously issues on this subject was read by the Secretary : –Circular It is a sentiment long felt and often expressed that something should be undertaken on behald of the emigrants who flock to these shores.Without any fixed destination they remain in the sea port until beocming victims of bad counsel and bad example they lose the pure and honest energies with which they left their native land and suffer worse than shipwreck in their moral qualities.The Government of this great Republic is well aware of the advantage to be derived from so great a mass of laborious industry when usefully directed and employed–and of adding to the nation's strength men whose attachment to the institutions of this country is assured by so many ties. But it is in the order of things that some of the friends particularly the countrymen of these emigrants who have been some time established and known should come forward to attest the necessity and guarantee the solidity of the enterprise.If his has not been done sooner it is because every advance in social improvement must come in its season. it is the ripeness of the occasion and the voice of the times that now speak.It has been remarked that among the lands nows open for sale and settlement there are some tracks particularly in the Illionois territory where the Irish emigrant with the instruments to which his hands are accustomed and in a climate congenial to his habits might procure to himself immediate shelter and subsistence–and in a few years be able to repay with gratitude the benefits conferred on him.We whose names are undersigned have met to consult upon the means of promoting some establishment that might be a rallying point for the distressed and give to the wanderer a habitation and a home. We have thought of no better way than to address by this circular the friends and well wishers of Ireland who co-operation might give most weight to the measure and to submit whether it might not be advisable to join all our efforts and petition Congress early in the ensuing session for a grant of a suitable track upon a credit of 14 or 15 years subject to such conditions and modifications as the Government may see most fitting.to the Government we would offer no deceptive delusive or precarious motive rather chusing to make its wisdom benignity and patriotism the anchor of our hope.We request of our if you approve of our sentiment and of our project to advance and promote it by your best endeavours ; either by forming organized associations or by obtaining individual signatures to a petition to the effect stated. We have not yet been able to digest a plan and have rather chosen to make this humble beginning in hopes that we should soon receive additional light upon the subject from cor respondence we solicit. We shall nevertheless proceed to investigate the subject and challenge the co-operation of good and respectable men and request of you to do the same.You will please address your answers and any future correspondence to Mr James Moffit No. 15. Frankfort Street New York.Thomas Addit Emmet. Denis M'Carthy William Sampson John R. Skiddy James R. Mullaney John Meyher William James M'Neven Cornelius Heeny Matthew Carroll Robert Swanton James Moffit. New York Nov 18 1817Mr Emmet then stated that he had been requested by the gentlemen who called this meeting to explain the objects for which it was convenued ; that it could not be necessary to expatiate before those he was now addressin on the situation of the peasantry and farmers in Ireland ; it was at present one of unqualified misetry partly occasioned by their local oppressions and partly by the general calamities of Europe ; it compelled them to fly to these shores in such numbers and under the pressure of so great poverty that the most active individual benevolevence could neither provide them with a sufficient present succour nor procure for them within a reasonable time the means of permanent settlement. The consequence was that many of those unfortunate strangers were totally lost to this county or forced by want to become noxious and dangerous to its cities whose original dispositions and qualifications if rightly directed and employed would have made them valuable and useful members of the community. Besides the accounts transmitted back to Ireland of their disappointments and destitute situations deferred many who were suffering at home the extreme of wretchedness from endeavouring to better their condition in this more fortunate and favoured land–to the political institutions of which they were also more strongly attached.A very painful reflection on these circumstances had suggested to come gentlemen then present the hope that the general Government might be induced by a strong and united application to grant a portion of its unsettled lands on terms liberal and bountiful so that an asylum might be formed for industrious and enterprising farmers who would gladly fly from famine and persecution to a spot where the sweat of their brows falling on a fertile soil would yield them a rich harvest for their own exclusive benefit and where they might peacefully enjoy all the blessings of that republication liberty they loved. The time for making such an application seemed auspicious ; party asperities had softened fown and probably few would now be led by political prejudices to give it opposition. Neither was it unprecedented ; a favour nearly similar had been granted to the French emigrants and to settlers from Switzerland.It is true we could not forth a pretence like the cultivation of the vine or the olive ; and we would not succeed by practising any delusion. We could offer nothing but an immediate accession of industrious and hardy settlers who in a congenial soil and climate would become enthusiastically attached to the country and the Government from whence they derived all their blessings and wherever they were found would form a barrier against every enemy. Much might undoubtedly be expected from the generous sympathy which the sorrows and sufferings of Ireland had everywhere excited in the United States and from the acknowledged liberality of its Constituted Authorities ; but very forcible arguments might also be addressed to its policy and interest. Not only those that in the ordinary course of events would arrive here whose usefulness is lost by the want of proper direction and who become burdens or scourges to our cities would be rescued and placed in a situation where all the energies of active and enterprising minds would be serviceable to themselves and the community ; but also the very fact that such an asylum was open and accessible would infinitely increase the amount of emigration from Ireland and people our wildernesses with incalculable rapidity. The place upon which we have fixed our eyes is in the Illinois territory–it has been lately purchased and is not yet even surveyed. In the ordinary course of events it is not likely to be brought into market (at least to any extent) for many years ; but if Congress listen to our application and grant to the settlers an extended credit Government will receive payment for the land probably as soon as if it were suffered to remain unheeded till its regular turn for sale came round. A large body of settlers will be enabled to grow rich during the time that the land would otherwise be waste and unproductive and the value of all the contiguous property belonging to the United States would be rapidly and immensely increased to say nothing of the advantages resulting from the strength of such a settled frontier. All these considerations may be strongly urged by men who can most truly say they are actuated by no views of personal speculation or emolument ; who are willing to enter into all the labour of procuring settlers and organising the establishment without any prospect of gain or even compensation except as to what may be necessary for defraying the expences of the undertaking ; and who are desirous that the actual settlers should enjoy all the advantages which Government may be willing to grant.These are our views–we conceive that they may be realized if supported by an united and active co-operation of those who think like us in other parts of the Union. We are therefore desirous of adopting and pointing out to others what seems to be the best mode of giving system to that co-operation ; namely the formation of societies totally divested of all party or political feelings and directing the attention only to this object. There are already a sufficient number of political institutions in every State in which the zealous partizan (be his opinions what they may) can act on them to their fullest extent. Let these societies be neutral groun or rather consecrated places in which when we meet we lay aside all our hostilities and join as brothers in our prayers and offerings at the shrine of our common worship. They are consecrated to every man amongst us by the purity of their object by our earliest recollections by our unbroken affection and our strongest sympathies– by the unextinguished love of our native land for which most of us have already renounced all sectarian antipathies and religious animosities ; which we offer as a solemn pledge to the country of our adoption that our hearts will be always alive from temperament as well as prin ciple to the emotions of patriotism ; and that those amongst us who have pledged their faith to her however they may seem to differ on some minor political subjects will always be found firmly ranged and united under the same banners and forming one phalanx whenever her more important interests are concerned.Mr Emmet then moved four resolutions which being severally put were carried with some slight amendments as follow :–1. Resolved–That it is expedient to form a Society of Irishmen and descendents of Irishmen for the purpose of endeavouring to procure from Congress a track of land in the Illinois territory to be settled by emigrants from Ireland. 2. Resolved–That every person of the foregoing description who shall on or before the second day of December next pay to the Secretary of this Meeting the sum of five dollars shall be entitled to become a Member of the said Society until the number of subscribers shall have amounted to one hundred after which time the subscribers shall be at liberty to elect their own officers and no person shall afterwards be admitted except by ballot. 3. Resolved–That it be recommended in Irishmen and the descendents of Irishmen in the other cities and towns of the Union to form similar societies for the purpose of corresponding and co-operating with that which is about to be formed in this city. 4. Resolved–That as the meeting of Congress will shortly take place and in order to prevent the less of time a Committee of fifteen be appointed to prepare the outlines of a memorial to that body to be submitted to the consideration of the Society when formed and organized ; and also to adopt such measures as they may think expedient for promoting and accelebrating the organization of that Society.Mr John W. Mulligan in seconding Mr Emmet's motion expressed in handsome terms how much he was gratified by the invitation to attend had given him the opportunity of claiming his title of descendent of an Irishman.A Committee was then appointed pursuant to the fourth resolution the number being upon motion and discussion augmented to twentyone.Committee–Andrew Morris Thomas Addis Emmet William Sampson John W.

Those persons who wish to become original members may do so by signing their names and paying their subscription to the Secretary before 2d December pursuant to the second resolution.After the meeting was adjourned the Committee organized itself and appointed Sub-Committees to report a draft of a constitution and a memorial to Congress and for the discharge of other requisite duties.,
ID126,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,28,inform,CanadaExtract of a letter from a Mercantile House in Nova Scotia to their Correspondents in this quarter.We sincerely hope that the Duties Government had in contemplation (last year) to impose upon Timber imported into Great Britain and Ireland from the British North American Provinces equal to the additional duty imposed on Foreign Timber in 1813 will be further suspended.Our[?] commercial system chiefly depends upon the encouragement of the Timber branch ; ships that carry away that article[?] bring us [?] at a low freight whereby we are enabled to furnish the British West India Islands with an abundant supply of Fish[?] and that on very moderate terms ; but in the event of Government persisting in imposing the Duty on Timber from hence that branch of our trade will inevitably revert to the Americans besides being the ruin of many in this and in the neighbouring Provinces.The supposed revenue that would accrue to the mother country upon trial will be found delusive ; to prove this many obvious[?] reasons can be adduced : As the trade now exists all the Timber extracted from these Colonies to Great Britain and Ireland is paid for in British Manufactures ; the export of so bulky an article as Timber and the import of so ponderous an article as [?] employs[?] an immense number of British ships ; objects certainly of more real value to the revenue of Britain than any benefit they could possibly derive from direct Duties imposed on the export of Timber from British North America. It cannot be denied that previous to 1813 when the additional Duty was laid on Foreign Timber they (the Foreigners) were not only the carriers but would not accept an ounce of British Manufacture in payment for their TImber–no nothing but you gold[?] which was so much in demand that 28s. was given for a [?]. Another very cogent reason [?] be advanced in favour of what is commonly denominated the Timber Trade from these Provinces ; it facilitates emigration and introduces many valuable settlers into this Province and the Canadas that would go to the States of America ; and the day is perhaps not so far distant when they would of accessity[?] become our enemies.When Great Britain was first involved in war with the eastern countries from whence the principal supply of Timber was derived the merchants in that line[?] as well as the ship-masters were not only alarmed but convinced themselves ruined ! The Baltic is shut[?] what shall we do for Timber and with our ships? They properly concluded that perhaps the British Provinces could supply them ; they made the experiment they were not disappointed–but succeeded far beyond their expectations. If therefore in time of war Britain has took to her colonies for a supply of such a necessary article as Wood ; it is not reasonable for us to conclude that their interests will not be wholly neglected when blessed with peace.Extract of a Letter dated Savannah 25th Nov. 1817In the Southern States this autumn has been the most fatal they have experienced since their colonization.

ID127,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,07,16,inform,CanadaPapers from Upper Canada contain the draft of a petition to the Prince Regent founded on the resolutions adopted in the province of Niagara where some discontent has been manifested. The first part is as follows:–To his Royal Highness George Prince of Wales Regent of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland &c. the humble Address of the Inhabitants of Upper CanadaMay it please your Royal HighnessThe subjects of your Royal Father dwelling in Upper Canada should need no words to give assurance of their loyalty if the whole truth had reached the throne of their Sovereign. His subjects have reason to believe that the truth has not been told.During three years of war Upper Canada was exposed to the ravages of a powerful and inveterate foe. The Government of the United States had been long concerting the invasion of this province. Hostile preparations against it had been long masked under other designs ; and at last the accumulated torrent of violence burst on the defencless children of the British empire. Nor were they assailed by the weapons of war alone ; an invidious proclamation preceded those host of the enemy forgetful of honour regardless of humanity and daring to seduce the subjects of Britain from their true allegiance. The subjects of Britain remained dauntless and firm. It was not for their property that they rose against their invaders ; the invader would have spared to them their property. They flew to arms in defence of the rights and sovereignty of Britain. Twice has the American standard been planted in Upper Canada while yet but a handful of British troops aided the native battalions wave the laurel of victory over the protrate intruders on their soil. The second year of war saw Canada contending with yet little assistance from the parent state. The second year of the war saw her sons confirmed in their virtue and still more determined to resist. Wives and children had fled from their homes ; the face of the country was laid waste and the fire of revenge was sent forth to consummate distress and misery ; still was the spirit of the people unextinguished still did it burn with patriotism and loyalty.By the third year every risk of conquest was at an end for now the British aid poured into the provinces and peace was proclaimed when war was no longer to be feared.It is now more than three years since there was an end of war but strange to say these years of peace have manifested no appearance of affection or care from the mother country to the Canadas. Commercial treaties have been made altogether neglectful of British interests here. Government transactions which used to give spirit to trade and are at a stand; troops are withdrawn ; fortifications are suffered to go to ruin ; and rumours are abroad too shocking to be repeated in the Royal ear. May it please your Royal Highness to listen calmly to the complains and grievances of the people of Upper Canada who are fully assured that your Royal Highness has been kept ignorant of most important truths ; who are well assured of the generous disposition of your Royal heart and of your desire that British subjects should every where share equally you paternal regard an affection.It was a matter of much provocation to the people of the province to see even during the war which afforded such striking proofs of their loyalty and valour reports went home highly rating the merits of regular troops while the tribute due to Canadian levies were unfairly set down may the principles of the most loyal subjects here were often stigmatised by British officers ignorant of human character and still more so of circumstances which affect it in this part of the world. It was not so with the immortal Brock. He justly appreciated Canadian worth and his memory will happily long cherish in the minds of the Canadian people a due regard for the genuine spirit of a British solider at once generous and brave.The loyal inhabitants of Upper Canada would disdain to notice the misrepresentations of individuals so contrary to notorious truth if these had not obviously conspired with other causes to lessen the regard which should subsist between British subjects here and at home to influence the conduct of Ministers towards the general interests of the province.The loyal subjects of his Majesty in Upper Canada suffered grievously during the war in their property and many were bereft of their all. A solemn investigation on this subject took place ; the claims of the sufferers were authenticated and there was every reason to expect that recompence would immediately follow ; yet nothing has followed but delay and insult. Surely if there is among mankind a single principle of justice that is one that the individuals of a nation ought not partially to bear the weight of public calamity. Surely individuals who have exposed their lives for Government should not be disgusted with finding Government regardless of those very principles which it is intended to sustain. The people of this province are well aware that their fellow subjects at home are pressed hard with taxations and far it is from their wish that relief should be afford from thence. Canada contains within itself ample means of exonerating Government from the claims of sufferers by war ; and it is within the fiat[?] of your Royal Highness to remove by a signle breath the evil now justly complained of. Millions of acres of fertile lands lie here at the disposal of your Royal Highness upon the credit of which under proper management not only the fair claims of loyal sufferers could be instantly advanced but vast sums could be raised for the improvement of the provinces and the increase of revenue to Britain.Another grievance manifesting the neglect of Government to the concerns of Upper Canada is equally notorious and must be still more abhorrent to the general feelings of your Royal Highness.The young men of this province who were armed in its defence had for their spirited conduct the promise of their commanders that land would be granted them as a reward for their services as soon as war was terminated ; and after this promise was universaly confided in the Parliament of Upper Canada passed an extraordinary law in the face of established British principles that militia should pass beyond the frontier. With these promises and in obedience to this law the militia passed beyond the frontier with alacrity ; yet since the peace the greater part of them had been denied the pledge of their extraordinary services and the land is unjudtly withheld.The petition further states that such ingratitude such dishonour such errors in policy could not exist without extraordinary influences and it recommends most important changes equally for the glory of the throne and benefit of the subject. It says that the scandalous abuses came some years ago to such a pitch of monstrous ingratitude the the home Ministers wisely imposed restriction on the Land Council of Upper Canada. It seems however that all this was insufficient and that confusion on confusion has grown out of this unhappy system. Upper Canada it is now said pines in comparative decay and that discontent and poverty are experienced in a land supremely blessed with the gifts of nature.It is insisted that the immediate interference of his Royal Highness might do much to remove the evils which spring from the system of patronage and favouritism and it asserts that the interposition of the British Parliament is more imperiously required. It concludes as follows:– Deeply penetrated with these sentiments and most seriously inclined to have changes speedily effected the loyal subjects of Great Britain dwelling in Upper Canada now take the extraordinary step of sending home Commissioners to bear this to the throne and humbly intreat your Royal Highness to give ear to the details which it will be in their power to relate: above all that your Royal Highness would immediately send out to this province a commission consisting of discreetand wise men men of business and talent who shall be above every influence here and who may be instructed to make inquiry into all the sources of evil.,

If these accounts should prove true I think the President will as good reason for recommending to Congress at the next session the abolition of the army as he had at the last for doing away the naval forces on the lakes– because it was more likely to involve us in war than to give us security and peace.

ID130,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,12,28,persuade,Emigration to AmericaOur paper of Thursday last contained a general view of some of the most popular publications on the subject of emigration and we shall now endeavour briefly to make an estimate of the good and evil which is likely to befal those who embark in this hazardous adventure.There is one important fact which we gather from all the accounts of America whether written for the purpose of praise or censure namely that there is a great demand for labour and that wages are high and this effect is necessarily produced y the vast space of fertile and unoccupied territory which lies westward of the United States towards the Pacific Ocean. It is this vacant territory which is the true spring of this American community. Here is the grand outlet for the superflouous population both of the eastern states of America and of Europe. To cultivate this waste there is a constant demand for new labourers ; wages are of course high – the labourer lives in comfort and if he is industrious he becomes in his turn a purchaser of land from the savings which he accumulates. If labour should become more plentiful and wages should fall this is the signal for new emigrations ; and thus this constant demand for labour in the western districts regulates its general price throughout the United States. In these circumstrances it is clear that a labourer provided he can reach this advantageous market for his labour will unquestionably improve his condition. But herein lies the difficulty. A labourer has seldon the means of of subsitence so far beforehand as to enable him to undertake so long a journey ; and if he enters upon the enterprise with insufficient means he is liable to starve before he can transport himself to his ultimate destination or he is forced to contract for immediate subsistence obligations little short of servitude under the weight of which he is grievously oppressed. These then form strong objections to emigrations in the case of those who are stinted to their means ; but where these objections can be surmounted those who can transport their labour from the overstocked market of Europe to the understocked market of America will unquestionably dispose of it to better advantage ; but if they have not the means they may as furely fail in the attempt and draw upon themselves aggravated misery and want. As to the consequences of emigration to this country we hold them rather to be beneficial than otherwise and we cannot easily account for the very absurd alarm which has been propagated on this subject. The evil in Europe is that every country is overcrowded with labourers who cannot find employment ; and is it not manifest therefore that the withdrawing of some of these will make more room for the labourers that remain – that the loss of those useless hands will rather be a relief to the body politic and will diffuse greater soundness and vigour through all its parts? That these effects will follow from emigration in this or in any other country in Europe we cannot doubt – and that the labourer if he can afford the expence of the jounrye will receive higher wages in America than in this country is equally clear.There is another class of adventurers who may possibly improve their circumstances by emigration although this is not so certain namely farmers with a moderate capital. An allotment of land may be purchased in the back parts of America at the Government price of two dollars per acre and an emigrant who can afford to but and to cultivate 100 or 200 acres and acts with proper judgement and skill may undoubtedly by a speculation of this sort be sure of a subsistence while by the continued emigrations from the eastern states the country being quickly settled all around him his property is daily improving in value. But a want of judgement in the purchase or a want of ability to cultivate the land after it is purchased may involve him in irrecoverable distress and ruin ; and to avoid these hazards no little discrimination and prudence is necessary.Such are some of the most striking advantages of emigration and we shall now state some of its disadvantages. The first and chief of these is the difficulty of effecting a settlement and of subsisting until the land which is purchased yields its first produce. The country is partly open ground or prairie as it is called or it is covered with almost boundless forests. A settlement in the woods requires incredible labour to clear it – labour is dear and not easily procured and this herculean task naturally devolves on the head of the family who is forced during the day to ply the axe in this laborious drudgery of felling trees and afterwards to follow the chace for a meal to his family. Here he must frequently sleep out in the woods ; and his body exhausted with his day's labour is exposed to the cold dews of night ; under such unintermitted toil his health declines and it is obvious that his family deprived even for a single day of his exertions must be reduced to the most deplorable straits. In many parts the country which is marked out for emigrants is extremely unhealthy in particular the banks of all the navigable rivers which afford the most eligible settlements both in point of fertility and situation are exposed to the most fatal maladies. The same causes which produce fertility produce disease. The overflowing of the waters from the autumnal and spring floods fertilise the land in a most wonderful degree ; but the exhalations of these stagnant waters under a burning sun are as fatal to the health as the deposits which they leave are favourable to the soil. Hence the many minute directions which are given to all emigrants in regard to their health. In a letter contained in the Emigrant's Guide we have the following advice to those who are descending the Ohio : If the weather becomes warm guard well against the smell of bilge water. But if you must descend in the spring go early – avoid all delay and remember you are fleeing for your lives. I have seen the havoc and I believed it not till then. Again it is observed Let nothing tempt you to fish in warm weather immediately on changing your climate. The effluvia of the shores is poison. To a European emigran the climate must be of course even more fatal ; and he either therefore lose his health or he must be continually tormented with anxiously taking care of it which makes it a question whether it is worth having on such terms. Such are the hardships through which if he has strength to endure them he at length emerges into ease and independence. These hardships however will no doubt be in a great measure avoided or at least mitigated if he has beforehand provided the means of subsistence until he can derive regular supplies from his own land. In this case he is less laible to be dislodged from his situation by the casualties to which all emigrants are necessarily exposed. – He is secured against the hardships of a first settlement and is more certain of attaining the wished for object of ease and affluence – To a farmer therefore or a labourer emigration presents a fair chance of a permanent settlement provided it is gone about with ordinary caution and the necessary degree of energy be exerted to insure success. But it is a gross delusion to imagine that an elysium is to be found in the United States or that mankind exist there on any more favourable terms than in this country and those who set out on any such visionary schemes are sure to meet with a woeful disappointment. With regard to other classes of society it does not appear that they will improve their condition by emigration to America ; there is no demand for clerks or professional men of any sort and no merchant has any thing to expect by removing his capital to the United States. In the back settlements there is a demand for schoolmasters to teach the ordinary branches of education and several emigrants of this class have met with good encouragement.In regard to the essential article of comfort it is apparent from all the best information on the subject that a person long resident in this country would change for the worse by an emigration to the United States. He would in the first place suffer extremely from the climate from the extreme cold of winter and the raging heat of summer the thermometer frequently standing at 98 degrees in the share with a clear sky and broiling sun and very little abatement of this exsessive heat being experienced through the night. His frame accustomed to the more temperate though unsettled climate of this country runs the risk of being debilitated by the change and at all events he must suffer extremely in his enjoyments and in his spirit from this cause. Nor we should imagine would the manners of the people in the back parts be found very agreeable or polished. It is admitted on all hands both by those who are favourable and those who are unfavourable to the Americans that if there is not as in Europe gross ignorance and debasement on the one hand neither is there on the other any thing much exalted above the ordinary level. But the inferences which arise from this established fact are strongly in favour of Europe. The grossness of vice and ignorance carries a sure antidote to its corruptions in the disgust which it excites : such examples are not so potent to debase as examples of a different sort are to purify and exalt. There is little risk that society will be contaminated by what is low and debased ; but on the other hand there is a certainty that what is exalted and illustrious in literature science taste accomplishments or fashion will exercise a powerful influence on the general state of manners. We naturally copy what we admire and those great and shining examples constitute a standard to which the whole system of life and manners has a tacit reference. In the United States they have no such models – they do not aim at so high a standard and taste and manners are therefore necessarily at a lower ebb than in Europe – Hence all accounts agree in reprobating the extreme filthy habits which universally prevail ; and Cobbett who will be suspected of too great partiality to this country draws a contrast between the inhabitants of Hampshire and those of the United States in which he places this vice of the American manners in strong colours ; and he adds as his reason for this that they have no gentlemen's seats with the fine improvements of pleasure grounds &c. dispersed through the country as models of taste and neatness for the inferior classes and it is to the same principles that we may trace other defects in their manners namely that they have no proper models on which to form themselves. Hence excepting in the principal cities we may safely conclude from all the information we have received on the subject that society has not reach the same degree of refinement as in this country.An emigrant accustomed to live in Britain would also feel the disavantages of American society strong in this that here in so closely peopled a community surrounded with all sorts of refinements life is assisted by such a variety of helps that it glides down the smooth stream of comfort and convenience without ever meeting with a single interruption. It is astonishing to what a pitch of improvement a society is brough abounding in wealth and in all the mechanical arts and where the ingenuity of thousands is incessantly on the rack to set on foot new devices for the common good. We are not duly sensible of the advantages of this because like other advantages they are familiar to us by long habit and we begin to imagine that they are inherent in the natural constitution of things. But when we are suddenly transplanted into a new community abounding indeed in subsistence but deficient in all comforts – where only the coarsest mechanic arts are practised – where the inhabitants are so widely dispersed that their common exertions cannot be made available for the common good we find life interrupted at every turn. In our former society if we had not the previous secret of transmuting all things into gold we had at least the power of transmuting gold into every thing else. But here the power of money is limited. We must indeed pay for services but we must also beg for them ; and thus we go on fretting and tormenting ourselves under petty incommodities which in this country would be remedied as soon as they were felt. It is incon ceivable how much inconvenience and discomfort and real unhappiness may spring from this cause. In this country by long habit and pracrice and continual improvement every thing has fallen into its right place – each individual has a separate task assigned him in the joint task of labouring for the general benefit – and the industry of all however variously directed tends to one common end. There is a perfect unity of effort. We all labour in common – we combine our efforts that they may yield the largest possible produce and this produce is accurately shared among the various members of the community each receiving the share to which his labour entitles him. Such is substantially the process by which commerce diffuses the benefits of industry over every civilized community. – Money is the instrument by which this division is effected. Every one who labours has the value of his labour ascertained in money which is a draft upon the common stock for whatever quantity of necessaries and luxuries he is entitled to ; and all these complicated operations are executed with a regularity almost mechanical. But in a community newly forming there is a want of unity and combination – all the members labour indeed but no one has his proper part assigned him – there is a jostling and an interference with each other – and when they come to divide some have too much and some too little of certain articles – the stock is ill assorted and money will not execute its functions. Hence disorder arises and inconvience and awkward wants and an individual suddenly removed into this region of discomfort from the happier climate of a highly improved community must be annoyed with feeling in the highest degree gloomy and disagreeable. He must have the same sensation as a person who quits an elegant mansion fitted up with every comfort and convenience for one of inferior quality and coarsely finished where he is exposed to a thousand annoyances every minute. It is observed by Dr Johnson that the evil of life does not consist in any sudden and overwhelming crash of misery but in a series of petty discomforts amd mischiefs continually preying upon the temper. The truth of this maxim those who emigrate from this country to the back woods of America will have a good opportunity of verifying.The prevalence of slavery in most of the States of the Union constitutes another capital defect in the structure of American society. These slaves form a degraded and oppressed class and in the tyranny exercised over them they themselves are morally destroyed while the corruption extends to the other orders of society equally infecting the oppressed and the oppressor and debasing the general character and habits of the people. It is vain to talk of liberty while stain of tyranny so deeply infects the domestic manners of a community. There can be no rational liberty unless we call that liberty which gives us the privilge of torturing and oppressing our fellow creatures. To give an idea of the consequences of this dreadful evil of slavery we may state that it is a practice in Kentucky to commit delinquent slaves into the hands of the public executioner by whom they are unmercifully flogged at the markey cross of the different towns the streets being filled with their pietous cries. What can we think of the people where such spectacles are for a moment tolerated. This is so utterly revolting to every just and enlightened feeling that to a European it would form a strong objection to his permanent residence in that country. In all the northern states and in some of the new states particularly that of the Ohio slavery is indeed abolished. But in several others the black form a large proportion of the population and they are not decreasing. We know indeed that this evil is admitted in its full extent by all the American statesmen that they lament it but do not well see what measures can be adopted to check it. The importation of new slaves is indeed prohibited but the increase of those already in the country is the great grievance against which it is difficult to devise a remedy and the cruel and oppressive treatment which slaves will always meet with wherever they exist must tend to degrade the habits and moral feelings of the community at large. To such therefore as are accustomed to European society where no such strain of tyranny infects the domestic manners an exchange into a community where his feelings may be revolted by spectacles of gross cruelty cannot be regarded as very desirable. If more imperious considerations permit they have certainly a greater chance for happiness by remaining where the rights of nature are respected than by removing to a society where every principle of humanity is trampled upon.,
ID131,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,02,26,inform,Interesting Communication from CanadaTo the Editor of the Edinburgh Weekly JournalSIR–It will be remember by many of your Readers that in the spring of 1815 proclamations were widely circulated inviting settlers to Canada.–Having myself occasion to visit this country I was curious to know what had been the result especially as I found at Quebec and Montreal very discordant accounts respecting it ; most people asserting that the scheme had failed of succcess and that the settlers were in a state of great discomfort and discontent.–To ascertain the truth I diverged from my route about 50 miles and spent some days at Perth situated on the waters of the Redeau to which a considerable body of the people who accepted the invitation of the Government had been conducted.– Here it traced the reported discontent to some neglect in the general management and some ill conceieved petty regulations capriciously exercised towards people tenacious of their rights ; but in the main universal satisfaction prevailed among the settlers and a strong feeling of the good intentions of Government towards them. The opportunity being a good one of ascertaining the progress which a promiscious body of settlers make in a given time. I constructed the annexed table and had each man's signature attached at once to prove to correctness of his statement and satisfaction with his situation. Should you think this worthy of publication you are welcome to publish it in your paper. It may draw attention of a most important subject–the colonization of this province with British subjects ; and it may afford satisfaction to many individuals who may not otherwise know the condition of their friends. The scheme which Government adopted in 1815 was expensive. The settlers had a free passage rations and tools. Next year rations and tools were furnished to those who came out ; and this year multitudes of poor people have come to Canada in expectation of being favoured in the same way but are disappointed ; having nothing given them but land (100 acres each) which many of them from poverty are unable to occupy. Having made it my study during thrre months residence here to inquire into the nature of the country and into every particular respecting settlement I am convinced that very simple measures might be adopted by which the redundant population of Britain could be conveyed by a regular flow into Canada instead of being wasted as it now is to the great prejudice of British interest over the whole of American ; and were such measures adopted this province would in a very few years be quite equal to its defence in war against the United States –I am Sir yours &c.

ID132,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,02,28,inform,Convicts destined for Botany Bay.–It is now seven weeks since the ten Derby convicts were sent off with several others whose destination for the rest of their lives is Botany Bay. They were upon landing at Sheerness from the Retribution put on board the Tottenham which was engaged to land them at their place of punishment. The number on board that ship on leaving Sheerness was between 2 to 300 many of whom were diseased and infirm. Their condition has been rendered most intolerable from an unaccountable delay that has taken place. The ship Tottenham had not proceeded farther than the Downs when she lost her rudder by some accident or other. She returned to Sheerness where she now lies and where she is likely to lie for some time upon the pretence that the loss she has sustained is a justification for delay however protracted. The unfortunate inmates have been led to expect that some important mitigation of their sentence has taken place ;–so that between the suspense and the terrible species of confinement to which they are subject their suffer ings are hardto be described.–Observer.The Hon. Lieut.-Colonel Erskine.–It is with the greatest concern we have to mentioned the death of Lieut.-Colonel Erskine Lord Erskine's youngest son on his passage to Ceylon. He served throughout the campaigns in Spain as a Captain of Light Infantry in the 51st regiment and behaved with great gallantry in the battle of the Pyrenees where being shot in the thigh he was sent home by the Medical Board and on his recovery was placed by the Duke of York on the Staff of the Army in the Adjutant-General's Department when the Duke of Wellington took the command in Flanders. He was in the battle of the 16th of June and afterwards on the 18th at the battle of Waterloo where his station placed him in the dangerous position of being attendant on the Duke around whom almost every officer was either killed or wounded. Amongst the rest this brave young man had his left arm carried off by a cannon-ball which passing along the other laid bare the whole of it by which he lost the use of two of his fingers but that arm was saved. When the cannon-shot had thrown him from his horse and as he lay bleeding upon the groun in this mangled condition the Prussian musketry and trumpets being heard at a distance he seized his hat with his remaining shattered arm. and waving it round him cheered his companions in the midst of the dying and the dead the Duke of Wellington being then close by him who desired he might carried to his tent.It must be some consolation to his afflicted family that he must have distinguished himself in the opinion of his great Commander as he was immediately recommended by him for the rank of Major though a very young officer and in a year afterwards to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel with the appointment of Adjutant-General in Ceylon and if he had then fortunately sailed for India his life might probably have been saved ; but his disposition being as affectionate as it was animated he could not be persuaded to leave Mrs Erskine who was pregnant and remaining here during the winter the cough with consumptive symptoms arising from his wound laid too deep a hold on him to derive benefit from the voyage and he died on his passage to India.Colonel Erskine was only 25 years of age and has left three sons and a daughter and an infant a few months old.The marriage of the Duke of Clarence with the rich heiress Miss Wykeham is said to be finally arranged ; and from what we observe it is not likely to suffer any delay from the late domestic calamity. it is said that the Prince Regent has given his own personal assent ; but whether it has passed through the constitutional forms and that the Royal Assent in Council has been given we do not pretend to know.

On this interesting subject it cannot be forgotten that King in Council refused his assent in three former instances.The refusal of the Princess Royal of Denmark arrived in town on Monday or Tuesday last week. On Wednesday it was communicated to his Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence and on Thursday he set off to Brighton offered his hand to Miss Wykeham and was a thriving wooer.Colonel Henry Fitzclarence the son of the Duke of Clarence lately deceased was a young man of uncommon energy of character and of talents and acquirements.

ID133,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,10,13,inform,Colonial IntelligenceDeath of The Duke of Richmond.By the Henry arrived in the rive from Quebec we have advices from thence of the 4th September three days later than the last accounts. They confirm we regret to say the intelligence received at Lloyd's on Friday of the death of the Duke of Richmond at Montreal where he had arrived on his return from inspecting the new settlements in Upper Canada. His body had been brought from Montreal to Quebec where it was lying in state at the time the Henry sail ed. His daughter Lady Mary Lennox continued in the most afflicting state and great fears were entertained for her recovery.Lady Sarah Lennoc his Grace's second daughter is married to Major-General Sir Peregrine Maitland. They accompanied his grace to North America and have remained there since he entered upon his Government. His Grace was the lineal descendant of the first Duke of Richmond natural son of King Charles II. by a French Lady who was created by his Majesty Duchess of Portsmouth and by Louis the Fourteenth Duchess of Aubigny in France. His titles were Duke of Richmond Early of March (English honours) ; Duke of Aubigny (French Honour) ; Duke of Lennox Early of Darnley and Baron Methuen of Torbulton (Scots Honours). The title of Aubigny was confirmed in March 1816 by Louis XVIII by causing the estate of Aubigny to be assigned to him and granting him the honours of the Louvre as enjoyed by his Grace's ancestors. He was a Lieutenant-General in the army Colonel of the 35th regiment of foot Gonervor of Plymouth Governor of Upper and Lower Canada and their dependencies Lord Lieutenant of the county of Sussex and High Steward of Chichester. –His Grace was born in 1764 succeeded his uncle Charles the late Duke in 1806 and married in 1783 Charlotte daughter of Duke of Gordon by whom he had issue seven sons and seven daughters all of them now living except his third son Henry Adam R. N. who fell overboard the Blake as she was sailing into Port Mahon in 1812 and was drowned. His Grace was distinguished early in life by a duel with His Royal Highness the Duke of York. He was of an open candid generous temper and of plain and unaffected manners qualities which were particularly conspicuous in Ireland when Viceroy of that country.His Grace is succeeded in the Peerage his eldest son Charles Earl of March now Duke of Richmond. This young Nobleman in the army has seen much active service under the personal auspices of the illustrious Wellington being one of his Grace's Aides-de-camp and was one of the Representatives in Parliament for the City of Chichester which seat of course becomes vacant. He was lately married to the eldest daughter of the Marquis of Anglesea and has issue a Son now Earl of March.The following is extracted from the Quebec papers:Quebec Thursday Sept. 2. This Province has again been visited by one of those afflicting dispensations of Providence which by separating by the hand of death the ruler from the people covers whole communities with mourning.An express arrived here yesterday morning from Montreal with the afflicting intelligence chief that his Grace the Duke of Richmond Governor in Chief of these Provinces had died on his way from Kingston to Montreal at the moment that he was hourly expected to join his family there from which he had separated in good health at Kingston one the 20th to complete by visiting the new Settlements the long and arduous journey in which he has been engaged.This melancholy and utterly unexpected intelligence spread with the greatest rapidity and impressed a deep gloom throughout the city. The flag on the citadel and on all the vessels in the port was hoisted half-mast exhibiting every where the signals of public mourning.His Grace's body immediately after his death was conveyed to Montreal. It reached this city last evening in the steam-boat Malsham and was removed this forenoon to the Castle with the usual military honours and followed by his Grace's Staff the principal Civil and Military Officers in the City and Garrison and a great concourse of mourning inhabitants.September 5. His Grace's remains were conveyed from Montreal to Quebec in a steam-boat. At ten o'clock one the morning of the 2d of Sept. they were removed from the vessel and placed upon a hearse upon the King's Wharf at Quebec from whence it was conveyed to the Chateau of St. Louis where they lay in state until four o'clock on Saturday the 4th September when they were removed to the place of internment in the Cathedral Church at Quebec.On the corpse being brought out the collar and insignia of the Order of the Garter with his Grace's military and other appointments being placed on the coffin the whole of the troops presented arms. On its being placed on the hearse the troops rested on their arms reversed.The procession then moved forward. It was composed of all the principals persons attached to the public military and civil departments.The military band filed off at the door of the Cathedral Church-yard and conducted it up the centre aisle when it was played on a platform the mourners remaining by the body. A signal was then given when the body was deposited – 15 guns being fired.Extract of a letter dated Quebec Sept 5 :– When I wrote the first side I did not expect so soon to communicate the melancholy event of the death of our Governor the Duke of Richmond who was attacked on his route from Upper Canada with symptoms of hydrophobia which terminated his mortal career at six miles from the settlement of Richmond. He was perfectly sensible of his situation and gave himself up from the first spasm which attacked : it was occasioned by a bite of a tame fox at Sorel on his way to Upper Canada about three months since. His death at this juncture is looked on as very unfortuante for this country as he possessed the entire confidence of Government and was about completing a plan of defence for the Canadas which when executed would establish a water communication with our extreme points perfectly free from interruption in case of a war with the States.We are happy to learn further that no part of his Grace's family was so dangerously ill as was at first reported. They are only in that situation which might be expected from so severe an affliction.Colonel Wilson had succeeded the late Duke of Richmond as Governor-General of both Canadas being the senior Officer on that station.Sir Charles Saxton and Major M'Leod Aides-de Camp to his Grace the Duke of Richmond have gone to Lake Winnipeg clothed with special powers to investigate the causes of the unhappy dissentions which are said to have been lately renewed in that quarter between the North West and Hudson's Bay Company.

Mr Gourlay was found guilty and banished the province.From the Quebec Gazette of 26th August :?This morning about 9 o'clock Lieut. Birch of the royal navy put a period to his existence by shooting himself through the head. We are informed that Mr Birch had for sometime previous to his death laboured under a melancholy state of mind. An amiable[?] wife and one child are the survivors[?] of this awful [?] The Annual Report of the Agricultural Society of Quebec has been published from which it is evident that a laudable spirit of enterprise has been awakened in that important country. The Committee who in the execution of their functions travelled through the greater part of Lower Canada conclude their Report by putting on record a testimony they justly conceive to be honourable to the character of the inhabitants of the country through which they passed. Although many hundreds of persons from all parts of their respective Counties attended the Agricultural Meetings which were frequently of four or five hours duration there did not occur at any of them a single instance of intoxication disorderly conduct or personal altercation.The Grand Jury at Nassau New Providence have brought in a bill against Sir Gregor M'Gregor charging him with aiding and abetting piracy by issuing commissions in the Bahamas to subjects of Power in unity[?] with Spain.A letter from Sierra Leone dated the 9th of March says– It is with the deepest regret I inform you that notwithstanding the liberality of Great Britain and the faith of Treaties the coasts swarms with slave vessels dragging thousnads of its miserable inhabitants into endless captivity.

Notice was also given to such of the labouring classes as had not passed the fever that they would be provided with tents and encamped on the neutral ground for their better security against infection should it unhappily appears in the fortress. They would not be suffered to proceed to town and follow their callings during the day but heir return to the encampment at night was peremptorily enjoined.We are happy to learn however by the latest advices from the British fortress that the garrison and inhabitants were not at all infected with the disease.,
ID134,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,01,02,persuade,Emigration to America.In answer to the remarks which appeared in our paper on Monday last respecting emigration to America and to the statements there given of the disadvantages which emigrants from this country might expect to meet with we have received a very abusive letter from an anonymous correspondent who appears very angry and like most other angry men seems more anxious to give full vent to his wrath than to assign any good reason for it. His first cause of quarrel is that we have stated the general want of cleanliness to be a prevailing defect in the back parts of the United States. For this we have the authority of almost every traveller who has visited those parts. The remarks of Birkbeck on this point are conclu-sive and striking: –' In viewing the Americans (he observes) and ' sketching in a rude manner as I pass along ' their striking characteristics I have seen a de' formity so general that I cannot help esteem' ing it national though I know it admits of ve' ry many individual exceptions. I have written ' it and then erased it wishing to pass it by ' but it wont do – it is the truth and to the truth ' I must adhere. Cleanliness in houses and too ' often in person is neglected to a degree which ' is very revolting to an Englishman.' America was bred in a cabin ; this is not a ' reproach – for the origin is most honourable ; ' but as she has exhanged her hovel of unhewn ' logs for a framed building and that again for ' a mansion of brick some of her cabin habits ' have been unconsciously retained. Many have ' already been quitted and one by one they will ' all be cleared away as I am told they are now ' in the cities of the eastern states.' There are I believe court-houses which ' are also made us of as places of worship in ' which filth of all kinds has been accumulating ' ever since they were built. What reverence ' can be felt for the majesty of religion or of ' the laws in such styles of abomination ? The ' people who are content to assemble in them ' can scarcely respect each other. Here is a bad ' public example. It is said that to clean those ' places is the office of no one. But why is no ' person appointed ? Might it not be inferred ' that a disregard to the decencies of life prevails ' through such a community?'To the same purpose Cobbett complains of the ' general (for there are many exceptions) sloven' liness about the homsteads and particularly ' about the dwellings of labourers. Mr Birkbeck ' complains of this and indeed what a contrast ' with the homesteads and cottages which he left ' behind him near the exemplary spot Guild' ford in Surrey.' He then proceeds to give the reasons for this. When the first settlers took possession of the country the ' example of neat' ness (he observes) was wanting. There were ' no gentlemn's gardens kept as clean as ' drawing-rooms with grass as even as a car' pet. From endeavouring to imitate perfec' tion men arrive at mediocrity ; and those who ' never have seen or heard of perfection in these ' matters will naturally be slovens.'He afterwards remarks –' The market day at Guildford is a perfect ' show of cleanliness. Not even a carter without ' even a clean smock-frock and closely shaven ' and clean washed face. Well may Mr Birkbeck ' who came from this very spot think the people ' dirty in the western country. I'll engage he ' finds more dirt upon the necks and faces of one ' family of his present neighbours than he left ' behind upon the skins of all the people in ' the three parishes of Guildford. However he ' would not have found this to be the case in ' Pennsylvania and especially in those parts where ' the Quakers abound ; and I am told that in ' the New England States the people are as ' cleanly and as neat as they are in England. ' The sweetest flowers when they become pu' trid stink the most and a nasty woman is the ' nastiest thing in nature.'In answer to all this our correspondent tells us that the Scotch are very dirty. This we admit was formerly and may still continue in some degree to be the reproach of the Scotch. But does this reasonable person mean to argue from this that dirty habits are amiable and ought not to be corrected.With regard to the difficulties of effecting a settlement we are borne out in our remarks on this subject by the authority of various writers and principally by the autheor of the Emigrant's Guide a work of great merit which combines an extent and precision of statistical information altogether unequally with the most enlarged general views of the state of the country both physical and moral. ' Most men (observes ' this judicious writer) on arriving in the United ' States expects too much. Perhaps the only ' essential advantages offered are the security of ' person and property and the cheapness of land. ' It demands excessive labour severe economy ' and exepmtions from extraordinary accident to ' succeed in a newly settled country ; and it de' mands the permanency of this continued la' bour prudence and favourable circumstances.'Our anonymous correspondent is also extremely displeased that we have stated so strongly the perincious effects produced on the general manners of the Americans by the existence of slavery ; and he mentions that many a labourer in this country might envy the condition of an American slave. What are those privileges for which a free man should envy a slave he does not think proper to state. To show however that we have not exaggerated the degradation and oppression of the coloured class in the United States we shall again adduce the authority of the Emigrant's Guide. The author is contradicting the notion that the labourer in the slave States is confounded with the negroe ; and he expresses himself in the following terms: –' A residence of 16 years in places where sla' very is prevalent enables us to contradict a ' general expression that in such places whites ' performing manual labour are confounded in ' the moral estimates of the people with slaves. ' Though less respect is certainly paid to useful ' labour in the slave states than where all the ' duties are performed by whites yet ' the distance between the two races of men are ' in all cases immense. So deep profound and ' inveterate is the feeling on that subject that ' not any where in the United States can pro' perty sobriety intelligence and every other ' advantage expect colour raise in public opi' nion a man the most remotely allied to the ' African to a rank equal to the meanest white. ' Any person who resides a few years in Louisi' ana will be witness to some very remarkable ' exemplifications of this innate contempt for all ' those who affinity involve them in the con' tumely heaped upon men degraded by slavery.'What a picture is here conveyed of misery and degradation on the one hand and of tyranny on the other. – Here we find it failry confessed that no degree of worth whether moral or intel lectual not even the possession of property can give a man the least degree of consideration in the eyes of the privileged class. We cannot conceive a community more wretchedly constituted. All that is estimable and worthy is here utterly contemned because the individual who possesses these qualities happens to have his skin of a particular colour and thus a merely accidental quality of the corporeal frame entails upon its unhappy possessor everlasting ignominy and contempt. These distinctions carried to such an excess seem to us to be founded on the extinction of every generous and honourable sentiment and we cannot help still asserting that we had rather live we at present are than in a community where such hateful antipathies rule to the exclusion of every just and humane feeling.With regard to the condition of the negroe slaves we shall quote a passage from Brown's Western Gazetteer or Emigrant's Directory after reading which we shall leave our anonymous correspondent to say whether he thinks the condition of a labourer in this country preferable to that of being an African slave. The writer describing the town of Lexington in Kentucky observes –' In this square stands the market-house ' which is of brick and well furnished on Wed' nesdays and Saturdays ; but occasionally the ' scene of a barbarous practise ; for it is here ' that incorrigible or delinquent negroes are ' flogged unmercifully. I saw this punishment ' inflicted on two of these wretches. Their ' screams soon collected a numerous crowd ; I ' could not help saying to myself These cries ' are the knell of Kentucky libery.'Having made this answer to the angry charges thus brought against us we have only to disclaim in the strongest terms all hostility or prejudice against the Americans. We have no wish either to depreciate their character or institutions. They exhibit the interesting spectacle of a nation advancing with an irresistible pace to wealth and greatness. To revile such a people would be the height of human folly and equally foolish is it for their blind admirers to take offence because endeavour to make a fair estimate of their character without hiding any of its defects.,
ID135,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,01,20,inform,Colonial Intelligence York (U.C.) Nov 4.Lord Selkirk vs. North West Company.On Friday the 30th of October the Court of Oyer and Terminer proceeded to try the gentlemen accused as necessaries to the murder of Robert Semple Esq. and others at Red River on the 19th of June 1816 and the trial was rendered extremely interesting by the disclousure which took place of many extraordinary circumstances connected with the Hudson's Bya and North West Companies which for some time past has excited so much of the public attention in this Province. The gentlemen tried on this occasion were Messrs. Alexander Mackenzie Hugh M'Gillis Simon Fraser John Macdonald and John M'Laughlin } accused as accessories after the fact. and Mr John Severlight accused as an accessory before and after the fact.It appeared in evidence that the North West Company had been upwards of thirty years in possession of trading posts called forts at different points on the Red River in the Indian Territories and it is well known that for a century before the North West Company the Canadian for traders had been in the constant practise of resorting to that country which was visited for the first time by traders of the Hudson's Bay Company about twenty-five years ago. It was put in evidence that for many years afterwards both companies carried on their trade to Red River without interference in each others pursuits and without any disturbance in the country ; and it was explained that the principal object of the trade being to collect provisions (enlisting chiefly of the dried flesh of the buffalo which abound in the plains) and the country producing abundance for the supply of both parties the same causes of dissention did not exist as at trading stations where the fine furs are obtained in small quantities and where rival traders would at all times be likely to dispute about the divisions of them. The Red River country therefore remained quiet and undisturbed until the arrival of the Earl of Selkirk's Colonists and Servants and the attempts made by their leaders to prevent the usual supplies of provisions from being obtained by the traders.The proclamation of Miles Macdonnell the soi-disant Governor of Ossinibour prohibiting the exportation of provisions from Red River was the first document produced for the defence at the recent trials. It was proved that under this assumed authority several acts of violence were committed by Mr Macdonnell and his followers. Trading posts and buildings were forcibly entered depots of provisions seized the river (the only outlet from the country) blockaded by batteries mounted with cannon and the trade of the North West Company wholly interdicted before any acts of retaliation were attempted on their part and even before they took any precautions for their own defence or for ensuring the safety of their provisions on which depended the existence of their trade and the lives of their people.Mutual and continual acts of aggression and retaliation appeared to have exasperated the minds of both parties and to have rendered them so suspicious of the designs of each other as to be always on their guard and prepared for defence. In short it appeared in evidence that the country remained in a state of private war which at length ended in the battle of the loch of Jane 1816. The particulars of this unfortunate affray were fully investigated in the trial of Bouche and Brown for murder as principals. The statements on both sides are already before the public and the acquittal of the prisoners shows sufficiently that the jury considered Mr Semple and his party to have been the assailants. On the trial of the alleged accessories the cirumstances which led to the meeting of the hostile parties were made out in the evidence to the following effect viz : –In March 1816 Mr Colin Robertson with an armed party acting under the orders of Governor Semple who had succeeded Governor Miles Macdonnell at Red River captured by surprise the North West trading post at the forks of the river called Fort Gibraltar and took possession of all the stores and provisions. In the latter part of the following month of May Governor Semple caused the buildings (which were of wood) to be taken to pieces and the materials were floated fown the river in rafts to be used in constructing his new fort which he called Fort Douglas and where (following the examples of his predecessors) he mounted cannon to command the passage of the river built an armed schooner or gun-boat to com plete the blockage and effectually to intercept the provisions and trade of the North West Company. Mr. Alexander Macdonnell a partner of the North West Company who had charge of their provisions at Riviere Qui Appele one of the branches of the Red River became alarmed at these measures of hostility and assembled as many people as he could (half breeds and others) for the protection of the property under his care with which at the usual time he proceeded down the river till he arrived within sixty miles of Governor Semple's fort. He then landed his provisions made dispositions to defend them if attacked and sent a party of his people with a temporary supply to meet the canoes from below apprise them of the blockages and concert with them the means of eluding or removing it. This party under the direction of Cuthbert Grant (a half breed and a clerk of the N. West Company) was ordered to land above Fort Douglas in order to keep out of the reach of the cannon and to carry these provisions in carts at as great a distance as possible from the fort so as to avoid being seen.– This it was fully proved they did ; but a swamp in the rear of the fort compelled them to pass within about two miles of it and being deserted and pursued from then the conflict ensued in which Mr Semple and most of his party were killed.It was further made out in evidence that in the Spring of the year 1816 the agent of the North West Company at Montreal were still in need of more than the usual supply of provisions from the Red River because there had not yet been time to replace the vessels on the lakes and the other means of transport which the Americans had destroyed during the war nor to replenish their stores at Fort William with the usual quantity of provisions from Canada. Having also heard of the seizure of one of their posts at Red River in the fall of the year 1815 and apprehending further aggressions in the spring Mr M'Leod one of the agents with all the partners and clerks who could be spared from Montreal proceeded up the country early in the Spring and on arriving at Fort William received intelligence of the capture of Fort Gibraltar and the blockade of Red River towards which place he immediately proceeded with as many of the partners clerks and servants of the Company as he could collect by the way in order to rescue the intercepted provisions in the defence of which or in their own defence if fired on by Semple's blockading battery it was their avowed purpose to use force if necessary but it was distinctly proved that their intentions and orders issued to their cannonmen were to pass Fort Douglas singing and to proceed up the river for their provisions without landing or molesting any one unless they should be attacked.–They arrived at Red River three days after the battle and Mr M'Leod who was a Magistrate being of opinion that Mr Semple's party had been the assailants and that the half breeds had only acted in self defence did not adopt any measures against them (the half breeds) but on the contrary expressed approbation for their having defended their provisions and gave them the supplies of clothing &c. usually given to all the servants of the North West Company while at the same time he arrest some of the survivors of Mr Semple's party and served subpoenas upon others to give evidence of these transactions in the Courts of Lower Canada. This was the whole of the evidence and the only circumstances which appeared relative to the prisoners were that Mr Sevewright (the alleged accessory before the fact) was with Mr Alexander Macdonnell when he sent off Grant and his party to escort the provisions past Fort Douglas and that the alleged accessaries after the fact arrived at Red River with Mr M'Leod after the battle was over and appeared to consider it as it is now found to have been an affray in which the unsuccessful party were to blame and in which the successful party were not murderers–The Judge who presided at the trial declared in his charge to the jury that there was not a scintilla of evidence against any one of these gentlemen and the jury accordinagly returned a verdict of Not Guilty.It will be recollected that these gentlemen were arrested by the Earl of Selkirk at Fort William in Aug 1815 on the charges of High Treason and Conspiracy as well as Murder–and that the buildings and property of the North West Company at that place were forcibly seized and subsequently retained by an armed force under his Lordship's command. The North West Company represented at the time that these accusations were merely a pretext set up to palliate the preconcerted plunder of their property and destruction of their trade while on the part of Lord Selkirk it was alleged that the crimes committed by the partners of the North West Company were so atrocious as to justify his Lordship's proceedings against them ; and for some time the public opinion remained in suspense as to the real merits of the case. So far as regarded the seizure of property and the interruption of trade the point was decided by the Prince Regent's Proclamation of the 3rd of May 1817 in consequence of which the North West Company recovered possession of their property and re-established their trade ; but that proclamation left the rights of parties and the crimes alleged against the individuals to be investigated and decided upon by the law – and until such investigation could take place much uncertainty necessarily prevailed from the contradictory statements and affidavits which had been laid before the public.The recent trials at York however decided the point as to the alleged murders and the charge of High Treason has never been followed up nor ever mentioned since it served the desired purpose by figuring in Lord Selkirk's Warrant as a pretext for seizing and examining the books and private papers of of the North West Company.,
ID136,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,01,04,inform,Reform in Upper CanadaIt has been already mentioned that Governor Maitland on opening the session of the Legislature of Upper Canada recommended that measures should be taken to prevent the meeting of delegates for obtaining reform in Upper Canada. Accounts from Quebec and Montreal dated the end of November state that in pursuance of this recommendation the Legislature on one of the first days of its meeting appointed a Committee to inquire into the subject who almost instantly came to the following resolution :?Resolved That it is the opinion of this Committee that some such legislative provision should be enacted as the wisdom of the Imperial Parliament has found it proper to provide to meet similar occasions to put it out of the power of any designing persons to organize discontent.The proceeding appears to have raised the indignation of the Gourlay or reofrming party in Upper Canada as will be seen by the following extract :–Montreal November 21. This legislative provision it will be immediate ly perceived is the suspension of the Habeas Corpus act for that was the course pursued in England. We do not believe that there is the most remote necessity for such a measure. We do not hesitate to say that the members have not spoken the sentiments of heir constituents in their echo of Sir P. Maitland's speech with the most humiliating servility ; and we feel convinced that it will not be borne with by the people while they have the control in any way of their representatives. The sentiment therein attempted to be disseminated is anlibel on the truly loyal people of Upper Canada. It would sound in our ears like the knell of their liberty if we were not persuaded that its adoption would provoke a spirit of resistance not corporal but mental ; not secret and illegal but open and legitimate which (if the Administration do not take the decision of the question from the people by force and we believe they cannot nor dare not) will serve to purge the constitution of the united province from the injury which it has received by mal-administration.,

The Earl of Selkirk and othersA bill of indictment for a conspiracy to ruin the trade of the North West Company and impoverish the partnes thereof was found by the Grand Jury against Thomas Douglas Early of Selkirk ; J. B. Chevalier de Lorimer Captain in his Majesty's Indian Department ; Captain Pratais D'Orsonnens late of the De Meuron Regiment ; Captain Frederick Matthey ditto ; Lieutenant G. A. Fauche ditto ; Lieutenant Frederick Graffenrad ditto ; Serjeant Jacob Vichie ditto ; Captain Miles Macdonnel late of the Canadian Fecibles ; Lieutenant Alexander Bridport Beecher late of the Royal Navy ; Doctor John Allen John Spencer Donald Macpherson James Chatelain John M'Nab Archibald Macdonald and John P. Bourke.The indictment contains three counts ; and amongst the numerous overt acts therein set forth supported by documentary and oral evidence the following were particularly prominent :– The engaging and armind a number of disbanded soldiers (foreigners) ; the entry of them by force of arms into Fort William in August 1816 ; retaining possession of the fort till May 1817 ; sending off as prisoners the partners of the North West Company found there ; getting rid of the clerks by subpoenas to appear at York at a period when no courts are held there without ever inquiring whether they know anything of the matters to which the subpoenas related and without ever bringing them forward afterwards ; stopping of the outfits from going into the interior and the returns from coming into Montreal ; possessing themselves of all the books and papers of the concern ; sending away the principal clerk under a charge of felony without examination and without having ever followed up the charge ; the pretended sale by Daniel Mackenzie of the North West property obtained by his Lordship by means of continued duress ; tampering with and debauching the North West Company's servants and commanding them in the King's name ; writing circular letters to the partners and clerks in the interior country advising them to abandon their trust alleging that the North West Company were ruined and to carry the furs to Hudson's Bay ; taking possession of Fort Lake La Pluie and the property there and stopping the navigation &c &c.Upon this being returned a true bill the Attorney General moved the process of the Court against the parties ; and Dr Allen being present was to be arraigned the following day.Wm Smith v. The Earl of SelkirkThis was a civil action brough by Mr Wm Smith against Lord Selkirk for false imprisonment.It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff was under sheriff of the Western District and as such the bearer of a writ of restitution founded upon a verdict of a special jury at Sandwich in October 1816 and granted by the Magistrate ordering the restoration of Fort William to the North West Company. He was also the bearer of a warrant for felony issued against his Lordship Dr Allen Captain Matthey and others upon an information upon oath before a justice of the Peace. Mr Smith got to Fort William on the 19th of March 1817 and produced his writ of restitution with which his Lordship refused to comply ; and when the Earl and others were arrested by Mr Smith upon the warrant for felony his Lordship laid hold of him and pushed him out of doors ; and he was afterwards kept in close custody in the fort under a military guard. A circumstance which added much to the grievous nature of the offence and which was particularly dwelt upon by the Judge in his charge to the Jury was that whilst Mr Smith was kept in a rigorous confinement Charles de Reinhard though under an accusation of was at large and keeping a school though nominally under the surveillance of one or two of his former comrades. The Chief Justice also remarked upon another part of the evidence for the defence by which it appeared that the only option left to Mr Smith to obtain his liberty was that of abandoning his duty and breaking his oath of office by a promise not to molest Lord Selkirk. Mr Smith however notwithstanding this proposal persisted in doing his duty and was not liberated until the evacuation of Fort William by his Lordship and his forces in May 1818.The Jury after some deliberation returned a verdict in favour of the plaintiff.– Damages L.500 Halifax currency.After narrating the military parages &c. at Richmond in America in honour of the 22d of February a journal says A melancholy catastrophe closed the day. Colonel W. Tatham so well known in England and this country for his acquaintance with civil engineering.–who has been residing in this city for two or three years but whose utility was considerably arrested by an unfortunate habit to which he had become addicted–was destined on that day to breathe his last.– In a moment of intemperance as he stood by the piece of artillery which was firing the evening salute he exclaimed that he wished to die. As the second gun was about to fire and immediately after the commanding had given the word Fire! Conolonel Tatham presented himself in front of the muzzle of the piece and by its discharge his abdomen was almost literally blown to pieces. His body was raised a few feet in the air by the explosion and he fell upon his face without uttering one word that was heard by the byestanders.– Colonel Tatham died without any family. Circumstances had strip life of much of its attractions in his eyes ; but it is impossible not to regard the manner of his death with horroer and to feel the deepest commiseraton for his melancholy fate. He was a man of great information of great genius and of great resource of mine. But to this melancholy end he has arrived.,
ID139,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,05,01,inform,LeedsApril 19.–We have been somewhat alarmed here to-day though no bad consequences have followed by a most numerous assemblage of croppers cloth-dressers and other artisans and labourers out of employment. They kep com ing in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley Armley Holbeck and all the neighbouring towns and villages and it is computed that at one time there were full three thousand of these distressed people assembled chiefly in Briggate. As many of them marched into the town with great sticks in their hands they created some little alarm but their conduct was uniformly peaceable; their complaints were not loud though they might be deep ! The worthy Mayor and Magistrates with the whole of the Civil Power were in rea diness to act as circumstances might require; but fortunately there was not the slightest occasion for their interference. By far the greater number of the assemblage dispersed by noon and returned to their respective homes. Several respectable gentlemen went among them to ascertain the motives of their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it does not appear that they have the least disposition to commit any breath of the peace ; but in fact the people know not what to do in their present state of distress. I understand that an active subscription is going to enable a number of these poor men to proceed to Canada; and others are said to have expressed their wish to be sent to Botany Bay provided they can obtain the sanction of Government. The case of these people is a very perplexing one ; for their numbers augment daily by fresh discharges from the various manufactories.ChesterApril 19.–John Bagguely John Drummond and Samuel Johnson convicted of sedition on the 15th inst. were this day after an adrdress from the Chief-Justice (Mr Serjeant Copley) sentenced to two years' imprisonment and to find security for their good behaviour for two years each in L.500 himself with sureties in L.100 each.We are sorry to hear that great number of the agricultural poor are out of employ in Monmouthshire and that the amount of wages diminishes as works get scarcer. Emigration to America still continues; but it is for the most part of a description of person who have afforded employ to others rather than require it for themselves. Many also take some property with them.Amongst the recent emigrations to the United States there are twenty six persons belonging to one family (Quakers of the name of Thistlewaith) lately residing in Meadow lane Leeds. These industrious and enterprising individuals are gone with an intention of carrying on the woollen manufacture (in conjunction with others) on an extensive scale either at Philadelphia or some other more eligible site in its vicinity. Several other families are preparing to emigrate from the same neighbourhood as well as from Dewsbury Bradford and other places in the vicinity. It is true these extensive emigrations may in some degree contribute to relieve our overburdened population ; but they must likewise tend in an equal ratio to impoverish the nation ; as every individual and family who emigrate setting aside the pecuniary wealth they carry with them take what is of far more consequence to a commercial nation–their talents and industry–articles at present of comparative small value in the country.The very heavy impost which is at present levied upon authors and publishers by being compelled under the existing Copyright Act to deliver eleven copies of every book published to certain public libraries is likely to be repealed by a Bill to be brought into Parliament in a few days. The body of evidence taken before the Select Committe of the House of Commons last year forms a most interesting display of the state of literary property in this country.Saturday last Mr Stuart and Mr Allsop were returned for the Borough of Camelford.Yesterday the Grand Jury for the County of Middlesex found two Bills of Indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury against five of the principal witnesses produced in behalf of the petitioner who were examined before the Select Committee appointed to try the merits of the election fo Penrhyn.Extraordinary Legacy.–A very singular cause is now depending before the Court of Session in Scotland respecting a legacy to the amount of upwards of fifty thousand poundsbequeathed by the late Earl of F. (who died at Berlin) to a foreigner who was one of his domestic servants. The payment of the legacy is disputed by the heir-at-law of the late Earl on the ground that it was given for a highly immoral consideration ; and from its novelty the case is of course the subject of much conversation in the Northern Metropolis. The arguments and pleadings in this extraordinary suit in which the most eminent counsel of the Edinburgh Bar are engaged display much classical as well as legal learning ; but no judgement has yet been pronounced by the Court. From the magnitude of the sum in dispute it will probably be finally determined by an appeal to the House of Lords.–Morn. Chron.Town Hall Southwark.–Thomas Wing was brought up by Reeve the Marshalman and examined before Sir John Earner[?] the sitting Magistrate charged on suspicion of robbing his employers Messrs Sentance and Flint grocers NO. 300. Borough High-street.The prisoner's detection was caused in the following singular manner :–He was porter to the prosecutors and was frequently about the shop ; a large house dog having seen him take money from the till which he tied in his pocket handkerchief followed him about till he saw him conceal it in a shed near the stables and then he came into the shop and appeared quite restless pulling every person by the skirt[?] and apparently wishing them to follow him. At length Henry Heydon the apprentice having occasion to go to the stable the dog followed him and having drawn his attention to the heap of rubbish under which the money was buried began to scratch at it till he brought the booty to view ! The apprentice brought it to his master who counted and found it to contain 12s. in copper coin. After marking it he desired the boy to place it in the same spot which he did and soon afterwards finding that it was removed he asked the prisoner some questions about it but he declared his ignorance of the whole transaction. Reeve the Marshalman was then sent for who on searching the prisoner found some of the marked ballpence[?] in his pocket.–Remanded. Bank Committee.–The Opposition Journals last wek asserted that the Rank Restriction Committee of the House of Commons intend to report in favour of Mr Ricardo's plan of paying in specie. That is the Bank shall pay next January in gold bars at the present price of gold L.4 1s. per ounce any quanitity of notes not being less than sixty or a hundred pounds' worth and that in two years afterwards they shall pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold L.3 17s. 10 1/2 per ounce. Mr Ricardo's plan goes farther. It recommends that the Bank shall never pay in coin but in bars of gold at the standard price ; in short that the Bank shall at all times buy gold when offered at L.3 17s. and sell it when demanded at L.3 17s. 10 1/2d.If the Opposition Journals be correct in stating that the Restriction Committee intend to report in favour of payments in bullion at the market price ; and should Parliament adopt that plan ; then there will be a very great saving to the nation in the expense of coinage the waste of &c. All the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in foreign commerce will be answered as well by payments in gold bars as by payments in coins and the danger of a domestic run on the Bank for gold coin in a moment of panic as in 1797 will be completely prevented. This is indeed at all times the only danger to which it is exposed. A run for coin on the Country Banks would instantly fall on the Bank of England and would cramp if not dry upthe currency throughout the empire producing the greatest confusion. Now if the Opposition Journals be correct the currency will be placed in perfect security at perfect ease. Nothing will be able to disorder it. If persons will hoard specie they must purchase gold bars or foreign coin or content themselves with silver.In the year 1815 and 1816 we imported corn only to the amount of L.800000 each year and then the value of gold was rather below the standard price. In the year 1817 we imported to the amount of six millions and in the year 1818 we imported to the amount of eleven million Sterling. During the last two years the price of gold rose. Should we have an abundant harvest or two and little importation of corn become necessary gold will again fall very low. The Bank will then be able to pay to buy gold to the full extent of Mr Ricardo's plan and to place their notes on a firm unquestionable foundation. The finances of the continent and of the world indeed–the sources and circulation of money will during peace gradually become steadier and better known. The East Indies at present drain away an extraordinary quantity of specie while Spanish America in consequence of her troubles yields far less than usual. It would be madness to fly in the face of all these circumstances by compelling the Bank to pay in gold coin. Perhaps it may be desirable to limit the issue of bank notes to some certain yet liberal amount. We pretend not to anticipate the Report of the Committee ; but if some rumours be true we augur favourably of it. It[?] is said Mr Tierney divided the Committee and stood alone in voting against the Report. Thus then the Report cannot be in favour of a very sudden or decided plan for the resumpion of cash payments or Mr Tierney would not have voted against it ; and yet it must hold out a reasonable prospect of a rational scheme for that resumption or the other five or six Opposition Members of the Committee would not have voted for it. –Courier.Grand Pigeon Match three Gentlemen of the Midgham Club against thrice of All England took place on Monday on Farnham Downs at twenty-one birds twenty-one yards distance from the gun for 150 guineas aside charge unlimited. Messrs Adams Russel and Holt were selected from the Crack Club against Messrs King Short and Keans. The sports were as follows ; Mr Adams killed nineteen birds and the remaining two were severely hit. Russel killed eighteen but lost one three yards out of bounds and Mr Holt bagged sixteen making a grand total of fifty-two from sixty-three. The Club was at first backed to win but the England shots were now backed freely at six to four as they were considered safe eighteen bird men. Mr King killed twenty but lost two out of bounds. Short missed his first three which brought betting to two to one onn the Club but he killed the next seventeen and missed the last bird. Mr Keans had seventeen to tie and eighteen to win and he was back at five to four and at two to one after killing eleven birds in succession. He however missed the seventeenth and had to kill the other four to win. He succeeded and the prize was won by once bird. It was altogether the most interesting match of this sort known for years.Letters from Petersburgh of the 15th ultimo mention that Prince Gustavus of Sweden son of King Gustavus IV. has obtained permission from the Emperor his uncle to proceed to England for the purpose of completing his studies at Oxford. Reports speak highly of the virtues and talents of this unfortunate young Prince who excites universal interest and sympathy in the north of Europe. In these feelings we must largely share for we cannot easily forget the associations with which the name of Vasa was connected not the services rendered by two Sovereigns of that Illustrious House to the cause of civil and religious liberty. It is said that a great Potentate whose generosity and magnanimity are proverbial has settled upon Prince Gustavus an allowance of L. 2000 Sterling per annum during the residence of the latter in England and that on the return of his Royal Highness to the Continent he is to espouse his cousin a Princess of Hesse Cassel who if rumour be correct has lately refused a matrimonial alliance with the new Swedish dynasty.Papers arrivedon Saturday from New York and Boston to the 15th ult. The National Intelligencer in an article occupying five columns under the head of Strictures on Mr Lacock's Report on the Seminole War defends the sanguinary proceedings of General Jackson. This production is said to have excited a great sensation throughout the United States being supposed to express the sentiments of the Executive. The General had left Washington for his residence in Tenessee. By an arrival from Aux Cayes intelligence was stated to be received that Sir G M'Gregor's troops had deserted him owing to the want of funds for their subsistence.,

The contagion was so rapid that it soon spread into the town shipping and country and proved equally fatal. The disorder was such it baffled all medical aid. The alarming symptoms were such that business was nearly suspended–the white population seeking safety in other islands or in the remote and healthiest part of this. I assure you that every thing had a most gloomy appearance ; and the disease was so contagious one man would hardly venture to touch another.

It states that the total number of Europeans who died in the Peninsula in 1818 was eight men three women and two children. We lost no civil military or colonial officer excepting one young Gentleman who died a month after his arrival and is included in the number.A letter from the Havannah dated 27th February mentions that the article of coffee is gradually rising in value and that an agent from Messrs Baring is making purchases there to the amount of 1/3 a million sterling in that single commodity.,colonial politics;weather;disease;disease

Hunt esq.Washington Hotel New Orleans Dec. 25. 1818.My Dear Brother – We arrived safe in the mouth of the Mississippi on the 10th of this month after a voyage of 82 days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in excellent health and very happy. There are 35 English vessels from Liverpool now here and a great many English emigrants from Yorkshire Nottinghamshire Lancashire Wiltshire Hampshire and Somersetshire ; and in fact from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed island we have left behind us ! Our ship was detained near a week in the river about 80 miles below New Orleans ; we all went on shore and had plenty of rabbit shooting. I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun by Knock corner of Fetter-lane. Henry myself and Mr Blake went one day into the woods to kill deer by night coming on we lost our road ; and differing in opinions we separated Henry and Mr Blake taking one road and myself the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods and did not return to us till the next morning. It being wet and Henry sleeping on the marshy ground in spite of the remonstrances of Mr Blake caught a severe cold and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days but he is now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In the river there are thousands of wild swans wild geese wild ducks woodcocks snipes and other wild fowl. If you were there you would kill a waggon load in a day as I know you have frequently killed a horse load in England ; but they are a thousand times more numerous here than I ever saw them in England ; this market swarms with them and very cheap. No game certificate required here. Myself Henry Mr Blake and the other passengers visited a French farmer about six miles below New Orleans : he has got 3000 acres of his own land whereon are sugar plantations sugar-houses & c. ; he made 250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year. He offers five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French settlements on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are the most slovenly and the worst farmers I ever saw. – They are very lazy bad managers and appear to use their negroes very cruel and work them very hard. The Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer as it is very unhealthy in the hot weather and the deaths are frequently seventy in a week. The scenery of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much like the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and Staines and many of the buildings are as handsome as those of Bath. Here is one Church which is a very beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spanish shops are all open and it is a market during the whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening gambling & c. We are at the Washington Hotel the best in the city ; it is expensive although very good living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each including claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm weather as in England and it is as warm here now as it was in England in July although not half so oppressive and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the election : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel most of them English. We do not trouble ourselves about politics in this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil and to reap the fair reward of our labour. On Saturday we were charged 100 dollars each for passage and four dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four quarters of the best peas rye grass seed and some more of Hill's Scots ploughs to be left at Messrs Brown and Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the Illinois. Mr Trimmer an Englishman has purchased 20000 acres of land near Mr Birkbeck and has taken twenty couple of hounds with him so that we shall have some hunting as well as shooting if we like. It is said that he is about to marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he tells me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over the Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they are the only thing wanting there. I should have brought over some with me but they may follow us ; as I understand the labourers with the pay of a dollar a day can live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer of L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply and others that I have seen from Illinois report that the farmer can get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says there is a good sure market and a fair profit and only one penny per acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to pay. Price of labour is very dear here ; we pay a dollar for washing every dozen of shirts cravats pocket handkerchiefs & c. & c. The price of a gallon of best rum is one and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my things shipped from England I have paid 92 dollars for. Although I should like England very well if it was not for the taxes yet from what I have seen hitherto I like America ten times better,emigration;settlement description;national characteristics;slavery;religion;wages
ID142,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,05,27,inform,Emigration to AmericaImportant Extracts of a Letter from a very Intelligent and respectable Engineer in Louisville dated January 20. 1819.The best time for coming to America I should judge to be in the summer to land in September so as to be able to get here before the weather was too cold. It is safe to settle in the beginning of winter or spring so as to inure to the climate by degrees. The best plan for coming is to take a part of the steerage of a vessel and find your own provisions; you will save more in this way over a cabin passage than would buy a decent farm here. The lands in this neighbourhood raise a crop of wheat and one of corn alternately and improve ; dung is never applied and is said to be hurtful. It is without question what the land here is as good as can be and when to this is added the heat of the summer one ought to be able to raise crops as heavy as they will stand. You wonder at 10 dollars being enough to clear an acre. It is not cleared all the trees under 12 inches are cut down and burned on the ground and the large ones are killed by cutting round the bark. The ground is then prepared for Indian corn by scratching it with a hoe or a kind of shuffle which from the looseness and mellowness of the soil is easily done and in this way sixty or eighty bushels an acre are sometimes raised. – the trees die in a few months and in three or four years fall down one by one and the roots will rot out in seven or eight years. It is a great want of sense in any new settler not to adopt the modes of this country proven to be the best adapted to the state of it by 200 years experience. The Americans of all other people I know of are the most ingenious in adapting the means to the end. I do not know if they have more sense than other nations but they certainly make it go farther. Every tools answers the purpose most effectually. This is evident in their axes. An American will cut down three times more trees and square three times more timber than the best of your wrights could do and not by more strength but by fitter tools. So it is with cutting their grain ; a man will cut down four acres of wheat in a day what what he calls a cradle scythe and lay it as refular for binding as reapers can do. Sixty bushels of Indian corn is the average of Kentucky ; but 25 bushels of wheat is about the average of an acre. It is easier farming here than with you on sundry accounts ; the soil is free few weeds make their appearance and when ploughed down are certainly killed by the hot sun. There are no frosts to injure the crop and no wet weather to destroy it when cut. Hay is made in two days and grain is cut one day and stacked or housed the next. From the shortness and mildness of the winter little provender is needed for the stock. Swine are raised at no expence. They breed and feed in the woods and only want from one to three bushels of corn to fatten for killing when they sell for five cents a lb. In the less settled parts of the country it is the practise to give all the corn to swine and then send them to market. A bushel of corn is equal in nutriment to a bushel of wheat for man or beast.,

General M'Gregor it seems left authority with Colonel Eyre to recruit men for his service and to ship them as he best could. – There are a number of idle gentlemen about Dublin at present and also many in the country who have been captivated with the speculation of embarking in the Patriotic cause and for some time they have appeared in the streets in fanciful uniforms. We understand that Col. Eyre has formed a Committee who treat with such young gentlemen as have the inclination to proceed on the enterprise and have money to pay for such rank as they may wish to possess under M'Gregor. The money thus furnished is made a stock purse to pay the freight of the vessel and hence it is necessary that the greater part of the adventurers should be officers ; for those who are contented with the humble station of privates are not required to contribute and their passage subsistence &c. must be defrayed by the common fund. Mr D'Evereaux from the county of Wexford is also raising men for the same service but under different circumstances. He professes to have authority from General Bo livar to grant commissions and to ship the men he may raise for head-quarters in Venezuela. Mr D'Evereaux has not yet dispatched any men and Col.

Of the rising of the Caffres there remains no doubt although it does not appear that Government have as yet received official information regarding it. The private accounts state that two valuable officers had lost their lives and also a great number of men. The Governor himself in order by his presence the sooner to suppress the Caffres had with a competent force proceeded to the interior. Great inconvenience was experienced for the want of cavalry in so extensive a country ; had not this been the case it was believed that in a very few days tranquility would have been restored.We are sorry to state that another hurricane has taken place in the Isle of France ; it commenced on the 25th January and has done great mischief to the shipping and also to the plantations of that ill-fated Island.A Dutch mail has arrived with papers to the 19th inst.

In the administration of their colonies in the east the conduct of the Dutch has always been cruel and oppressive ; and it is to be regretted that the extensive and fertile island of Java should have been surrendered to their rapacity. During the short time that it was in possession of this country various important improvements were introduced into its domestic administration ; the practise of torture according to the humane and enlightened maxims of British jurisprudence was abolished ; new and better modes of collecting the revenue were adopted ; and a spirit of mildness and of regard for the interests of all the various classes of which the population is composed was evinced which made the British Government highly popular.Considerable anxiety prevails among the merchants for the safety of the Queen Charlotte Jamaica packet.

ID145,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,06,28,persuade,Emigration.The increased population of this country as well as the great difficult to which the middling classes of society are exposed in their efforts to procure the ordinary means of sustenance has given rise to the formation of little copartnerships or joint stock companies of individuals who being unable to command capital enough singly to encounter the expences of a new settlement have put their little funds together with a determination to sail for America and there jointly to labour for the general good of the whole until fortune shall so far favour their efforts as to enable them to become independent of each other. By this means much less than the hundred pounds stipulated by Mr Birkbeck as the proper stock for an emigrant to begin with will be sufficient ; and thus a new impetus will be given to that tide of huma beings which is constantly flowing towards the new world. Would it not be policy to give encouragement to these industrious swarms to settle in our own colonies? We have heard with some pleasure in rumour that several parishes have taken into their serious consideration the prudence of establishing a fund for the encouragement of those poor persons who may be dispoed to seek a means of occupation in Canada ; in furtherance of which laudable design an application is to be made to Government for grants of land in desirable siutations especially in Upper Canada where the climate is described to be of the finest description. There is no doubt that many who are now pining in workhouses would gladly accept of such an alternative and who instead of being as at present a burthen to themselves and to society would by their exertions be adding to the importance and stability of our possessions in that quarter as well as opening a new source for the consumption of our manufactures.,
ID146,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,06,28,inform,Letter from Mr Morris BirkbeckEnglish Prairie (Illinoia) Nov.25. 1818.Sir – Your favour of 15th June is before me. Presuming you retain a copy of the queries I proceed to answer then in order: – Respecting domestic servants ; what may be the condition of our colony in two years it is impossible to foresee but should it be in your power to bring with you female domestics it would be well to do so ; also a carpenter or two and a few labourers ; if with families so much the better. Written engagements for a term or indentures are not binding unless renewed on this side of the Atlantic. I have not seen any of these documents and can therefore give you no precise directions for them : perhaps a simple engagement from the parties acknowledging as a debt the expence incurred in bringing our might be a sufficient security leaving their wages to be determined here according to the current rates yet to be established by the proportion of supply to the demand which as I remarked above it is now impossible to ascertain. As to the number of labourers or female domestics you would need perhaps six of the former and two of the latter would a safe adventure looking to the colony for an addition should you need it after you are settled – before that you will find a greater number an incumbrance : this is I think all I can say to your first third fourth and fifth queries. All expence of transfer of your family and luggage supposing the latter to weigh ten thousand pounds I should estimate under L.1000 sterling. On this particular subject Mr R. Flower would give you most particular information – The luggage would cost about ten dollars per 100 lbs. So much for your query. To the seventh query – I think L.200 would assist your family in plenty for a year exclusive of wages and clothing. Eighth query – L.3000 would be a good capital for a section or 640 acres and I question your wishing to hold in cultivation a larger tract. Ninth query – I consider our situation not liable to future disturbance from Indians in the event of a war between Great Britain and the United States being covered by increasing settlements to the west north-west and north. Tenth query – The earthquakes mentioned by Bradbury I have heard of from many persons ; but I have not discovered that it has left any impression on the public mind ; on this score for my own part I feel no anxiety about the matter ; Great Britain I suppose in proportion to its dimensions is equally liable to earthquakes. Elenventh query – The route by New Orleans will I have no doubt be preferable to that by the eastern cities. When due precaution against the diseases of the climate are observed I have never failed to recommend it. Twelfth query – The health of my family has not suffered from the climate. One of my sons has been affected with ague. This summer has been more sickly in these parts than any season for seven years past and has afforded me a most encouraging confirmation of the temperature and salubrity of our settlement and has also afforded immeasurable proofs of those facts regarding the sufferings of new settlers to which I have so anxiously invited the attention of the readers of my journal. On the whole provided common sense should be seconded by common industry in the inclosure and cultivation of our colony I think we shall not be visisted by more than our due share of physical calamity. I deferred noticing your second query the subect being connected with the proposal respecting land at the conclusion of your letter. I would strongly recommend your deferring the purchase of land until your arrival. It would be difficult to convey to you the reasons but you would feel the propriety of my advice should you come. I think you would have as good a choice two years hence as now because excellent siutations as yet unsurveyed will then be on sale. I have no eligible offer to make you beyond a section. You inquire concerning venomous reptiles ; they are no source of injury or alarm to us. Insects in new countries often abound to an astonishing degree and are sufficiently teazing to man and beast. Many species yield instantly to cultivation and are heard of no more as plagues ; others will continue until conquered by order and industry. The thermometer ranges from 13 below zero to 89 above ; the extremes are of course of rare occurence and short duration. At Philadelphia I understand it rose this summer 97 and in this neighbourhood in the low river bottoms I believe it might reach that degree. On our praire I think it never reached 89.

It will be read with peculiar interest and it enables us to answer in the most satisfactory manner the many inquiries which have been addressed to us upon the nature and extent of the plan of which the Chancellor of the Exchequer submitted an outline to Parliament just before its prorogation.(Official Circular)Downing Street London 1819. I have to acquaint you in reply to your letter of the – that the following are the conditions under which it is proposed to give encouragement to emigration to the Cape of Good Hope.The sufferings to which many individuals have been exposed who have emigrated to his Majesty's foreign possessions unconnected and unprovided with any capiral or even the means of support having been very afflicting to themselves and equally burdensome to the colonies to which they have proceeded the Government have determined to confine the application of the money recently voted by address in the House of Commons to those persons who possessing the means will engage to carry out at the least ten able bodied individuals above 18 years of age with or without families the Government always reserving to itself the right of selecting from the several offers made to them those which may prove upon examination to be most eligible.In order to give some security to the Government that the persons undertaking to make these establishments have the means of doing so every person engaging to take out the above mentioned number of persons or families shall deposit at the rate of L.10 (to be repaid as hereinafter mentioned) for every famly so taken out provided that the family does not consist of more than one man one woman and two children under 14 years of age. All children above the number of two will have to be paid for in addition to the deposit above mentioned in the proportion of L.5 for every two children under 14 years of age and L.5 for every person between the ages of 14 and 18.In consideration of this deposit a passage shall be provided at the expence of Government for the settlers who shall also be victualled from the time of their embarkation until the time of their landing in the colony.A grant of land under the conditions hereafter specified be made to him at the rate of 100 acres for every such person or family whom he shall so take our ; one-third of the sum advanced to Government on the outset shall be repaid on landing when the victualling at the expenceof Government shall cease. A further proportion of one third shall be repaid as soon as it shall be certified to the Governor of the colony that the settlers under the direction of the person taking them out are actually located upon the land assigned to them ; and the remainer at the expiration of three months from the date of their location.If any parishes in which there may be a redundancy of population shall unite in selecting an intelligent individual to proceed to the Cape with settlers under his direction not less in number and of the description above mentioned and shall advance money in the proportion above-mentioned the Government will grant land to such an individual at the rate of 100 acres for every head of a family leaving the parish at liverty to make such conditions with the individual or the settlers as may be calculated to prevent the parish becoming again chargeable with the maintenance of such settlers in the event of their return to this country.But no offers of this kind will be accepted unless it shall be clear that the persons proposin to become settlers shall have distinctly given their consent and the head of each family is not infirm or incapable of work.It is further proposed that in any case in which one hundred families proceed together and apply for leave to carry out with them a minister of their own persuasion Government will upon their being actually located assign a salary to the minister who they have may have selected to accompany them if he shall be approved by the Secretary of State.The lands will be granted at a quit rent to be fixed which rent however will be remitted for the first ten years ; and at the expiration of three years (during which the party and a number of families in the proportion of one for every 100 acres must have resided on the estate) the land shall be measured at the expence of Government and the holder shall obtain without fee his title thereto on a perpetual quit rent not exceeding in any case L. 2 sterling for every 100 acres ; subject however to this clause beyond the usual reservations–that the land shall become foreited to Government in case the party shall abandon the estate or not bring it into cultivation within a given number of years. I am Your most obedient humble servant. * The usual reservations are the right of the Crown to mines of precious stones of gold and silver and to make such roads as may be necessary for the convenience of the colony.,

General Maitland assured them he would not depart without adopting measures in their favour and immediately issued a proclamation appointing a commission of payment. Sir Frederick Adam fills the office of High Commissioner ad interim during the absence of the Governor.Advices from Demerara are received to the 3d ult. The following is from the Guiana Chronicle of the 24th May:– We observe by St Vincent: papers which we have just received that the Royal York Rangers under the command of Colonel Smelt had embarked on board the Diadem and Elizabeth transports for Canada where the regiment is intended to be disbanded. It is stated that each of the men will have a certain portion of land allotted them in that province for cultivation and their future support.We have received Newfoundland Papers to the 23d ult by which we learn that in the Court of Session on the 18th idem Capt.

This production is of the same stamp as him other lucubrations abounding with strong and vigorous assertions in place of facts–a well wove sophistry to beguile the superficial reader ; and some of the most egregious errors in colonial policy recommended with a speciousness well calculated to deceive. Having so often stated out dissent from the political proceeding of this reformer it would be deemed intrusive by many of our readers to enter into a refutation of the tenets or an exposure of the absurdities contained in his address. By others we might be supposed as exalting over a prostrate foe. Both imputations we utterly disclaim ; while as men we regret that the mad career pursued by Mr Gourlay has deprived society of the benefits which might have been reaped from his better talents (of which he doubtless has a share) we must as good subjects feel happy that his career has been checked without any bad consequences to society.The following is the present distribution of the forces in the West Indies:– 2d Regiment (or Queen's) –Demerara. 4th Ditto–Head-quarters Grenada five companies; Trinidad three companies ; and Tobago two companies. 5th Ditto–Head-quarters Antigua five companies ; St. Christopher's four companies ; Montserrat one company. 9th Ditto–Head-quarters St Vincent's five companies ; Dominica three companies ; St Lucia two companies. 21st Ditto (Fusileers)–Barbadoes. 1st West India Regiment–Head-quarters Barbadoes six companies ; St Lucia one company ; Dominica two companies ; Antigua one company. 3rd Ditto–Head-quarters Trinidad five companies till further orders.

There are also extensive and fertile lands towards Saldanha Bay. As the produce from the new colonists will consist of grain and as the markets of the Cape of Good Hope the Isle of France Brazils &c. will in all probability be soon overstocked the settlers will look to the mother country for a market when an unfavourable harvest renders the import necessary ; and in anticipation of this event the merchants interested in the Cape trade intend we understand to make an application to Government respecting the Corn Laws to put the corn from the Cape of Good Hope on the same footing as grain from the British North American colonies.,
ID150,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,07,07,inform,Colonial IntelligenceThe accounts received on Tuesday from the Cape of Good Hope are to the 17th April which are considerably later than those previously received.Information has just reached Cape Town that a detachment of troops joined by a number of the inhabitants who had been sent to suppress the Caffres had succeeded in driving them back and were compelled to cross the river. The corn districts were in a great measure cleared of the savages and the country-people were returning to their homes where they considered themselves secure from any further attacks at least for some time to come.Letters have just been received via Calcutta from New South Walves up to the end of November. The colony was then all well and several convict-ships (the Marley Glory Mario Isabella and others) had arrived having made the passage out direct in the short period of three months and twenty days and landed all their convicts and passengers in good health. This may be considered as another among many proofs that it is unnecessary to make any stay at any intermediate port.Extract of a letter from Sierra Leone dated January 9It is with the deepest regret I inform you that notwithstanding the liberality of Great Britain and the faith of treaties solemnly entered into this coast swarms with slave vessels drugging thousands of its miserable inhabitants into endless captivity. A few days ago arrived here the Union of Liverpool : the supercargo states that during his stay in the River Calaba not less than eight vessels averaging 500 slaves each had sailed for the Spanish Collective.Montreal May 11We learn there are about 70 souls mostly Canadians preparing to set out from this place the 25th inst. for Lord Selkirk's settlement on the River Rouge. The number of settlers there at this time it is said amount to about 590. An intelligent Canadian in easy circumstances with whom we conversed and who goes thither with the before-mentioned settlers with all his family says he passed a winter there when engaged in this for trade and reports it to be a fertile country and the climate much milder than that of Canada. Thus there is every appearance that this Colony in the course of time will become populous and flourishing.,

It broke out near Conder and Tracy's store and burnt all between that and Messrs Baine Johnson and Co.'s.Cape of Good HopeAt the present moment under the prospect of emigration all intelligence coming from this quarter is of peculiar interest. The letters which reached town [?] Tuesday mention that the Caffres had commenced [?] tilities anew and that their numbers were very considerable.Cape Town May 5. The Caffres have broken out and a very serious war is carried on at present on the borders. It is said that the savages are to the amount of 50000 and a detachment of 6000 attacked Graham's Town on Saturday week about 12 o'clock in the day but were repulsed and 150 left dead on the fiel. They carried off 500 wounded. Orders have been issued in every district of the colony for the young boors to inrol themselves to oppose the enemy.Cape Town May 16. The 13th regiment commanded by Colonel Wilshire have come up with the main body of Caffres near Graham's Town and have defeated them with great loss. Since then they have withdrawn from the British territory. The 54th regiment arrived at [?] place a few days ago from England and have since[?] marched off for the frontiers. A large number of infantry have been mounted on horseback to [?] them to pursue more effectually the savages. They are all in excellent spirits. It is reported that our present Governor is going home and that another has been appointed.Jamaica Papers to the 10th ultimo has reached us which confirms the sad accounts of the miserable fate of the followers of the fugitive M'Gregor. It appears that the schooner Marsha[?] had brought accounts from San Blas[?] that M'Gregor after his disgraceful flight from Porto Bello proceeded[?] in the brig Hero for St. Andreas where he arrived on the 7th of May and left on the 12th having suffered considerably from the effects of his leap. He promulgated a story that he had been betrayed by some of his Officers who had [?] Porto Bello ; but added he would soon receive reinforcements from England when he would retake it.The Blossom arrived on Sunday from the South American station last from Rio Janeiro whence she sailed on the 8th of June. She landed about two millions of dollars at Rio Janeiro from Litna[?] and brought to England about 140000 on merchants' account. She and the Andromache Captain Shirreff having [?] treasure on board passed Lord Cochrane's squadron in the South Seas but his Lordship did not discover even the slightest intention of interrupting either of the ships. His Lordship's squadron appeared in excellent order ; and it is but justice to his Lordship to state that he has not resorted to any undue or improper means to man his ships ; but on the contrary in every instance of complaint made to him by the masters of merchant shipping of any of their crew having deserted to him he ordered the men to be again instantly sent on board their respective ships.,
ID153,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,09,22,persuade,Emigration to the Cape of Good Hope. (From Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.)The Chancellor of the Exchequer has submitted to Parliament the expediency of voting t50000 towards the encouragement of emigration to the Cape of Good Hope. Let it be remembered once for all that it is not because that colony is too thin of inhabitants but that the mother country is too full that this plan is suggested. The question is not how you maintain a surplus peasantry in the land that gave them birth but whether you will stop emigration to the frozen shores of Canada and to the United States or divert and encourage it to the finest colony in the world – We surely have learnt enough of North America to convince us of the degraded and miserable conditions of its people. South African on the other hand has every advantage to repay the sacrifice of quitting the land of our forefathers.The more fully to understand and appreciate these advantages we shall set before our readers a short view of the conditions and facilities of the colony in question.The spring from September to December is the most agreedable season. The summer from December to March is often intensely hot. The autumn from March to June is generally fine and pleasant. The winter is rainy and stormy and for the most part so cold as to make fires very comfortable during the months of July August and September. Most of the diseases that appear among the natives proceed rather from their gross and indolent modes of living than the unheathliness of the climate. The scarcity of water in summer is unfavourable to cultivation ; and for want of industry or materials this defect is not remedied as it is in India by artificial tanks or reservoirs. Whenever however irrigation can be employed either from wells or rivers the most abundant vegetation ensues. Good and abundant water has always been found by digging wells in Cape Town and the vicinity. In the whole colony there is scarcely a river that can be called navigable. Though swollen into torrents during the winter most of them dry up during the summer. All the rivers are well stocked with perch eels and small turtle ; and with a certain distance from the coast they abound with the several fish peculiar to these seas.There is general want of wood in South Africa – At the distance however of 1.5 miles from Algoa bay there is a large forest of a many thousand acres. Some of these trees (taxus elongatus) grow to the amazing size of 10 feet in diameter and to the height of 30 or 40 feet of trunk clear of branches. The wood is useful for many purposes but will not bear exposure to weather. The iron-wood grows to the size of 3 feet in diameter and the trunk straight and very high – The Hassayni wood is a beautiful tree...The Constantia wine is known throughout Europe and to what perfection the other wines of the colony are capable of being brought may very fairly be augured for the great improvement that has already taken place in its manufacture. Heretofore the Dutch farmer and the merchant have regarded more the quantity than the quality of their wine. And when a cargo was once shipped it mattered little to them whether sound or sour it reached its destination. Little care was taken in the growth of the vine ; the branches were permitted to rest upon the groun ; while decayed and unripe grapes stalks and leaves were all promiscuously thrown in the wine-press. The mode also of seasoning the casks with brimstone and the want of good brandy to fit it for foreign markets have all contributed to deteriorate the character and confine the sale of Cape Madeira. These defects have lately been in a great measure remedied. Proper persons have been sent out from Madeira and this country and every care seems now taken to meet and secure the growing demand in European markets. The trifling duty affixed to Cape Madeira in this country has been the means of introducing it into many families which have hitherto used home-made wines. And though the merchants at Madeira have made many remonstrances on this preference it surely is but equitable that encouragement should be given to the stape export of a colony now decidely and we must trust unalterably English. But in addition to wines there are other articles of colonial growth exported to the East Indies Europe and America. Grain wool bides and skins whale oil and bone dried fruits salt provisions soap and candles aloes tobacco. Such are the articles of commerce that might be turned to the best account. – But neither trade nor prosperit of any kind will continue to thrive in this colony under the present mode of administering its government and laws. It has been said that despotism would be the best of governments were the despot virtuous. This may be ; but contituted as human nature is we fear that the purest amongst us needs some control. Control however there is none over the governor at the Cape. He makes and annuls laws at pleasure. He inserts a proclamation in the Cape Gazette and from that moment his fiat becomes the law of the land. He has indeed an adviser in the colonial secretary whose influence does not extend beyond that of mere advice. Strange to add the laws at the Cape are at this moment Dutch laws rescinded and obscured by all the edicts of the different governors of the colony. All pleadings are in writing and were till laterly carried on foribus clausis. In 1797 a court of appeal for criminal and civil cases was established over both of which the governor presides. In India in the West Indies and in Canada there is a governor and a council. These act as checks upon each other. But at the Cape there is no appeal beyond the governor.The taxes however at the Cape under which we groan so painfully in this country are comparatively trifling. European luxuries very justly pay a heavy import duty but their purchase is matter of choice.– This falls not upon the poor not consequently will it fall upon those most likely to emigrate under the provisions of the Parliamentary grant.Noting indeed can be framed with greater care and precautions than the encouragement bedd out in Mr Vansittuart's proposal. A small deposit L. 10. is to be made at the colonial office in Downing Street by each individual. A free passage is to be granted and on reaching the Cape this deposit is to be returned to the settler by the local government. And such is the liberality that has guided the proposed plans it is moreover stipulated that if 100 families should agree to emigrate and their minister with them not only permission will be granted them so to do but provision will be made for him. The separation from country and from kindred is thus softened and it will allay many a sorrowing regret and painful recollection that in distant lands and amongst a strange people the settler may still listen to the voice and instruction of a pastor to whom custom veneration and affection have all united to attach him.It appears that the experiment of a settlement of English has already been made upon a limited plan at Saldanha Bay (the finest harbour in South Africa) : and with such success as to give the best encouragement to a more extensive emigration. Indeed from what we have outselves seen of the colony and its great facilities we have no doubt whatever of the benefits that must arise to the sober steady exertions of the industrious. At the Cape or elsewhere poverty and misery will attend the vicious and indolent but certain we are that there is no country under heaven where the poor may find a safer asylum and where activity economy and good conduct will meet with so certain and full a reward.During the stay of the 93rd regiment of foot (a Scotch regiment) at the Cape many of the privates were known to save the whole of their pay and were thus enabled to return to England with a very hand some little fortune. English servants of all descriptions are in great request and 1.5 sterling a month are no uncommon wages for a tolerable cook. It is nevertheless to beremember that clothes of all kinds are expensive at the Cape as no manufactory is permitted lest it should injure the trade of this country. Still farmers in the country dress very coarsely and cheaply ; and their wives and daughters except on Sunday are humbly clad as themselves. Indeed in so soft a climate as the Cape there is that occasion for multiplicity and warmth of apparel which colder regions require. For three-fourths of the year the best bed is a hard mattress with a single coverlet.There is point which we cannot pass over ; as we think it very intimately connected with the virtue and happiness of the settlers. And that is the education of their children. Nothing is more neglected than this in Southern Africa. The boors (farmers) are ignorant to a degree passing credence. With the minister that is to accompany 100 families it would be highly expedient to send a few sober intelligent men as schoolmasters. Attempts have been lately made to introduce into the colony the Madras system of instruction and a free school upon that plan has been established at Cape Town with considerable success. Still the natives are stubbornly averse to instruction. Their luxurious and bountiful climate supplies them with all the necessaries of human life and beyond this they have neither wish nor ambition. But if knowledge has its fruits ignorance has its weeds. The savage and unparalleled cruelties that have heretofore been exercised towards their slaves and the Hottentot servants by these Dutch boors may very fairly be traced to want of education as a main cause. The unjust limits shown by the Dutch laws to the white man's barbarities have doubtless encouraged their perpetration – Cruelty is not the character of Englishmen and therefore too much care cannot be taken to guard the families of the new settlers against the contagion of the inhumanities that they must see practised around them and how far an early and thorough acquaintance with our duty to God and man will counteract this influence aided a knowledge of common school attainments we need not say. TheWe have thrown these remarks together more as loose hints for the consideration of our readers than with any idea of furnishing a complete view of so wide and important a subject. We may be induced hereafter to review the question more in detail. The plan itself as confessed by the Chanceller of the Exchequer has at present assumed a very imperfect shape. Americe we have not seen and can only speak from the reports of other. Those reports are sufficiently discouraging. On the contrary all who have seen and described the Cape have united in praising it. Food is cheap and abundant the price of labour is exceedingly high trade is important and increasing many parts of the colony are beautiful and its climate is mild and healthy. There are few countries upon earth where so many components of happiness will be found to concentrate.,

Another account states that the Venezuelian army under General Bolivar in person had obtained possession of Santa Fe and that his advanced guard was at Honda[?] ; he had succeeded in cutting off the retreat of General Samana[?] the Captain-General of Santa Fe ; his Secretary Ramirez has arrived at Carthagena with the above intelligence ; it was also added that a part of Bolivar's army would soon be in Mempaz[?].There have arrived at the port of Quebec this present season 9513 settlers.A letter from Demerara of the 14th August says that a severe shock of an earthquake had been felt in that colony for the first time since the memory of man[?]. It occurred on the 12th. and continued for 30 second[?].Madras April 14. The gratifying intelligence of the fall of Asserghur reached the Presidency yesterday. We wait with impatience for the official details.Madras April 17. It is with since regret that we announce the death of John Duncan Esq. third Member of the Medical Board at this Presidency at General Lang's gardens. On Saturday last the 10th instant. The funeral took place on Sunday evening with the honours due to his rank ; and is remains were attended to the place of internment by a numerous assemblage of his friends at the Presidency. Mr Duncan's valuable services were for mroe than 30 years devoted to the benefit of the public and the relief of suffering humanity[?] ; and during the whole of that period it may be truly said that he always evinced a firm humane[?] and honourable disposition the remembrance of which must render his memory universally respected.Calcutta March 24. A Treaty has been concluded by the Hon. Sir Stamford Raffles[?] on the part of the Most Noble the Governor-General with the Sultan of Jahore and Tomangong of Sincapore establishing a British Residency at the latter place under Major Furqubar with a settlement on the ruins of the ancient captial of that country over which we may congratulate our readers that the British flag is now flying ; Sir S. Raffles having returned from this expedition to Penang[?] on the 4th of last month. The grant of this island which is situated at the southern extremity of the Peninsula of Malacca[?] must become valuable to the British Government especially when accompanied as we understand that it is with the privilege of establishing further settlements along the extensive coast of Jahore which must afford considerable protection to our commerce in that quarter particularly to ships passing through the Straits and enable us to watch the proceedings of our Bataxian competitors.Cape Town Gazettes to the 1st of August have come to our hands. At the present moment when plans for colonising the territory adjoining the Cape of Good Hope occupy so much attention we turn to these papers with peculiar anxiety. They however contain little notice of public events at the Cape ; and nothing whatever is said of the incursions of the Caffres. We collect incidentally that the scarcity which lately prevailed at the Cape has entirely ceased ; ample supplies of wheat and flour having lately been imported or brought to market.Maritime IntelligenceFriday a Court Martial was assembled on board the Queen Charlotte in Portsmouth harbour and continued by adjournment during Saturday to inquire into the circumstances of the supposed concealment of two deserters from the band of the 18th regiment of foot on board his Majesty's ships Phaeton[?] Captain W. H. Dillon in the month of October last when that ship was about to proceed to the East Indies; and to try Lieutenant John Geary the first Lieutenant of the said ship for his conduct upon that occasion. The Court[?] was crowded with officers &c. from the shore each day. The prosecution was closed on Saturday afternnoon and the Court adjourned till ten o'clock on Mon day when Lieutenant Geary made his defence. The Court having considered the whole of the evidence were of opinion that the charge was proved and sentenced him to be dismissed his Majesty's ship Phaeton and severely reprimanded.Letters from Port Jackson New South Wales dated March 30th were receivedon Sunday. The ships Surrey and Lord Sidmouth with convicts from England arrived on the 4th and 11th March. A schooner of 80 tons burden intended for the Chief of the Society Islands was to be launched on the 7th of April. The Shipley with dispatches and troops on board was to sail on the first and may therefore be expected daily in this country.,
ID156,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,11,10,inform,Colonial IntelligenceSpanish Town Jamaica–August 31.The mail will convey to you sufficiently afflicting news of the voyages which the fever is committing amongst us. Part of the 92nd and 50th have made their escape on board the Serapis 64 which has been roofed to and most handsomely and humanely given up by the Admiral for the use of the troops. The loss in men stands about thus: 59th[?] 200[?] ; 92d 120. The 58th and 81st are scattered[?] ; but from all I can learn their loss is not great. The following is a list of the officers and their relatives who have fallen victims in the course of this month : –Lieut.-Colonel Sparrow Deputy Adjt.-General. Lieut.-Colonel [?] 52d regiment. Lieut.-Colonel Hill th[?] regiment. Major Rowe 50th regiment son-in-law of Paymaster Montgomery of the 50th. Mrs Rowe wife of Major Rowe whom she survived but a few hours and daughter of Paymaster Montgomery. Major Montgomery 50th son of Paymaster Montgomery. Mrs Montgomery wife of ditto. Assistant Surgeon Brown 50th son in-law of do. Lieut. Richardson 50th. Lieut. North[?] 50th. Lieut. and Adjutant Lyon 50th. Two Misses Lyon daughter of Adjutant Lyon. Lieuts. R. M'Donald and George Mackie 92d. Ensign [?] [?]th Doctor [?] Medical Staff. Captain and Paymaster Turner 58th. The Misses Baxter daughters of Quarter-Master Baxter[?].The scenes that have occurred during this awful mortality have been most distressing. It has not been confined to the military for the inhabitants have even out numbered them.The Quebec Mercury of the [?] gives long extracts from the American papers respecting the [?] of a large tract of country by the [?] Indians to the British Government 2748000 acres stretching from the upper part of the midland[?] district towards the lower part of the province in the rear of the old settlements on the Ottawa and not in any manner coming into contact with or approach within many miles of the boundary of Louisiana. Yet upon the supposition that Great Britain is thus extending her Canadian territory the American Papers are loud in their invectives against this country.Letters have been received from Mogadoru[?] dated the 28th September which mention that the plague which had been for some time in the vicinity had at length broken out in that town. We are happy to add however that the deaths at that period were only three or four each day and it was then confined to the Moors ; none of the Christians or Jews having fallen victims to the pestilence. The weather being extremely cold great hopes were entertained that the further progress of the disease would speedily be put a stop to when trade which then at a stand would renew its wanted[?] activity. The whole population of Mogadoru is between 10 and 12000 persons ; by far the greater part of whom consider it contrary to their religious tenets to use any caution to prevent their taking the infection ; and in the event of their having it would not for the same reason have recourse to any means to counteract it.,
ID157,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,02,15,inform,Emigration to America[ From the Observer. ]The following letter from a lady who emigrated to America from within four miles of Godalming in Surrey two years back has been handed to us for insertion. During the present rage for emigration we think we are justified in giving it insertion leaving it to those who are interested in its contents to draw their own con clusions. We have reason to conclude that the letter is genuine and is not we believe as many have been which have found their way into the public press the produce of ingenuity on this side the Atlantic: –Philadelphia July 29. 1818My dear Sir – I have received your welcome letter together with the patterns you were kind enough to forward Although our habits here are in many respects different from those on your side of the Atlantic yet I assure there is a considerable degree of anxiety among our American belles for English fasions ; and the display which your prompt attention to my request has enabled me to make has procured me not alone a great influx of visitors but of business. You ask me to give you my candid opinion of the policy of removing hither with your wife and family. I can have no hesitation in complying with this request ; but at the same time I shrink from the responsibility of your being persuade from any things which I may say to follow my example. It is impossible to disguise from myself and I would not attempt to disguise it from you that many who have come here anticipating prosperity and independence have failed ; but at the same time as far as my humble observation has enabled me to judge I am persuaded that many of those failures have been the result of unpardonable imprudence and the absence of that activity and spirit of perseverance by which persons depending on their own exertions can alone expect to succeed. I have seen many individuals here reduced to very melancholy straits from having left their native shores thoughtlessly without more money than was sufficient to support them for a fortnight. –. This has been dissipated on their landing almost before they had recovered the effects of a long and fatiguing voyage ; and being thus reduced to extremity their spirits have failed and they have at once sunk into a state of apathy and listless despair. Those who have labouring and mechanic trades to follow and will sumbit to degradation as some of them call it of becoming journeymen do tolerably well.With regards to myself I need not recall to your mind the species of drudgery to which I was forced to submit in order to support a decent appearance in London. You often joked me on my enterprising disposition and doubted my resolution to come to this country in search of that independence which I foresaw I could never obtain at home. Here I am however and an hour since I had the pleasure of paying 30 work women the lowest of whose weekly wages I those who take their work home is five dollars! You will start at this and so will Mrs B. It is however no less true than extraordinary. In short I have every reason to be grateful to Providence for having given me the confidence to sufficient to try an experiment which has turned out so fortunately. I have commenced both millinery and dress-making to which I have added the childbed and ready made linen business ; and in every one of branches I am full of orders. My most sanguine hopes have been realized. My capital at the beginning was exactly 1.60 Sterling and a few of those articles of stock which were necessary to make a show. These combined with the attractive titled of Miss P– from London'&c. in a few weeks set me afloat in a surprising manner. I did my utmost to please my customers and in a few months moved from a situation of obscurity to one of the first respectability. I am thus particular because I know you feel an interest in my fate. My brother James who you know is a bricklayer and builder has been equally fortunate.– He has had several contracts and is now building a row of twenty houses besides other jobs of a smaller description.Of the other fiften persons who accompanied us from Godalmbing and its neighbourhood I am proud to say they have all been tolerably successful. The greater part of them you know were farmers and they are now settled in farms of from fifty to five hundred acres from one hundred to one thousand miles from this place. All these hoever came out with small capitals–but none with less than myself–and husbanding their resources and abstaining from extravagance of every description they finally successed in laying the foundation of their own future happiness.We all have our own prejudices in favour of our old habits ; but this must wear off in the course of time?other there is a roughness and absence of what we call good manners about some of the Americans not at all congenial to English taste. They are for the most part however hospitable ; and if you let them have their way and do not thwart their humours are really very kind and disposed to friendly intercourse. You talk to carrying your family to the Western states–to the Illinois country and of commencing farmer and storekeeping there. It is probably that your views may be very correct but I think you may settle nearer to us if not at so cheap a rate at best with a greater certainty of present comfort. Of the Western States I of course can know nothing but by report. The emigration in that direction has been immense but the journey to some has been so long as frequently to produce repentance before the destined goal was reached. We have had several English Scotch and Irish families here on the way to Pittsburgh who I understand were bound for Mr Birkbeck's settlement ; but I have not heard of their arrival. The greater part have gone down the Ohio in arks which you say you have seen described in Birk beck's books. No doubt these people must have to encounter great privations and perhaps some danger ; time and perseverance howeverwill overcome all difficulties and from the natural course of things in the end the great object in view plenty and independence must be attained ; and this as you very justly say is worth a struggle. Upon the whole if you can be content to give up all those luxuries of which an English fireside is the scene ; to abandon the habits of social intercourse to which an English neighbourhood give encouragement ; and to derive happiness from the consciousness of seeing yourself surrounded by an abundance of the necessaries of life alone ; you cannot fail of success. I agree with you that a vast deal of the pleasure of England are counterbalanced by the castant visitation of the tax-gathered. From these at least you will be free here ; and as for society your own family large as it is must be a treasure in itself ; added to which in proportion as wealth increases civilisation must follow. If you could get three or four families with whom you are acquainted to join in your plans and settle in your neighbourhood an additional assuance of success and happiness would be attained.As to capital I think you ought to hav on your landing here L. 500 which with moderate exertions and common good fortune must afford yo uthe means of certain prosperity. I shall however write again in September on this subject when I intend sending for my sister and perhaps the information I may be able to collect in the interim will confirm your plans and induce you to accompany her to this side of the water. I rather think we shall shortly have another cargo from Surrey ; I will let you know every particular in my next as well as send you a list of the things which it will be policy for you to bring with you. Your seven children instead of being a burden to you here will form one of the most prominent sources of your wealth.,

(From the Sydney Gazette Nov. 8. 1815)By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fowler and part of the crew of the Indian brig Matilda which sailed from this colony in August 1813 bound on a voyage to the Derwent and Eastern Islands and from thence to China but was cut off and plundered on the night of the 10th of April last while lying at anchor in Duff's Bay at the Island of Rooapoah one of the Marquesas on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted and joining with some of the Rooapoah natives took the opportunity of a dark night and the wind blowing fresh right on the land to cut the vessel adrift by which means she drove on shore through a heavy surf and was soon bilged and filled with water. When the cannibal natives saw that it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat they concurred universally in the design of putting the whole of her crew to death; which appears to have been a constant practise among the different natives towards one another when their canoes happen to fall upon a strange shore through stress of weather or from any other accident.Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their chief or king Nooahetu who presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate mariners to instant slaughter. He withheld his assent to the murder; but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of the vessel– The crew were informed by such expressions as they could understand as well as by gesticulations that accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion that their lives were dependent on the issue; the good chief was opposed to many other chiefs who though somewhat inferior in rank were very far superior in number supported by the common usages of the island from which the exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated with his son by his side on a mat in his own dwelling; he had been called to the supremacy of the island by the general wish of the people as it was not a hereditary right but an elective dignity. His people pressed their solicitations earnestly and at length peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length of time opposed by the force of words which not seeming likely to prevail he adopted a method which silenced the whole in an instant and saved the lives of Capt. Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his expostulations were defeated on the principle of undeviating custom he deliberately took up two ropes that were near him and fixing one round the neck of his son and the other round his own called to the chief next in command who immediately approached him. His conference was short and decisive: he first pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of his son and then to the other which he had entwined around his own. These strangers are doomed to death said he by my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit that I who am their King should live to see so vile a deed perpetrated. Let my child and myself be strangled before it is performed and then it never will be said that we sanctioned even with our eye-sight the destruction of these unoffending people.The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce even in the mind of the unenlightened savage a paroxysm of surprise mingled with a sentiment of admiration in which the untaught man may possibly excel his fellow- creature whose conceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a moment the people looked wildly upon their king whose person they adored because that his principles were good and his government just and mild. They saw the obedient chief to whom the order of strangulation had been imparted staring with horror and amazement at the change which a few moments had produced; The mandate which had proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed; and commanded to perform the dreadful office he proceeded to obey when a sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance. The King! the King! from every lip burst forth–'What! kill the King! No no let all the strangers live–no man shall kill the King!

They form distinct factions and make war upon the ruling chief. The rebels are denominated the typees; and the opposite parties are horribly sanguinary towards each other. Six of the adverse party were killed and devoured by the rebels while Captain Fowler was among them and the following de testable circumstance occurred on the occasion: A native man belonging to Port Anna Maria who was not tattooed and in consequence prohibited from the eating of human flesh on pain of death impatient of the restraint fell upon one of the murdered bodies and darting his teeth into it in all the madness of a voracious fury exhaled the crimson moisture which had not yet coagulated.The chief of Port Anna Maria who is very friendly to Europeans is named Ke-atta-nooe the first part of the name implying the outrigger of a canoe and the latter signifying great. The dress of the men consists merely of a wrapper about the waist; the women are covered from the shoulders downwards to the ancles and are generally fairer than the Taheitan women. The chiefs have no distinguishing mark or ornament but in the mode of wearing their hair; which the common orders wear tied up in a large knot on each side of the head a stripe of which extending from the forehead to the hollow of the neck is kept shorn which practice the chiefs do not adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the worms to be more prevalent and destructive to the ship's bottoms there than he has any where else witnessed; and to this cause attributes the caution of the natives in drawing up their largest canoes some of which contain from 80 to 100 warriors. They are anxious after every kind of property carried among them for barter and this is supposed their chief inducement for attacking vessels when they can do so with a probability of accomplishing their object.– They have no knowledge of the use of muskets and have none among them except a few at Port Anna Maria. A gentleman at this time in Sydney who resided among them about fifteen years ago in a Missionary capacity describes them as a people constantly employing their thoughts on plunder and devising schemes for taking advantage of strangers. Their population is very numerous; which he remarked to some of them to whom he gave a description of Otaheite observing at the same time that its in habitants were less numerous:– Can't we go and take them?- What is there to hinder us? was immediately demanded.

Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted and joining with some of the Rooapoah natives took the opportunity of a dark night and the wind blowing fresh right on the land to cut the vessel adrift; by which means she drove ashore through a heavy surf and was soon bilged and filled with water. When the cannibal natives saw that it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat they concurred universally in the design of putting the whole of her crew to death; which appears to have been a constant practise among the different natives towards one another when their canoes happen to fall upon a strange shore through stress of weather or from any other accident.Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their Chief or King Nooahetu who presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate mariners to instant slaughter.
