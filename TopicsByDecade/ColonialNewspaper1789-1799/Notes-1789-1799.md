#Notes-1789-1799:

##Purpose:
I'm going to keep quick notes on observations in each decade folder to organize my thoughts for when the whole thing comes together online.

##Thoughts:
When I examine the force cluster we see topic 8 is the most predominant, it appears the most, topic 9 and 5 appear the least and everything else is split. What conclusions can be drawn from this? What topics are these? Examine.

Topic 8: "/"town ship governor company appearance property passed high distance supposed""
Topic 9: "/"river house st part fire settlement considerable virginia places ten""
Topic 5: "/"citizens peace present states tribes put service provision nation national""

We can compare these topics to the larger graphs from all the data we collected and make conclusions on media during this decade based on the averages of the time.
