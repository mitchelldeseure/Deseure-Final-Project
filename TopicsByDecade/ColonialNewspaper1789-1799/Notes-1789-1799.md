#Notes-1789-1799:

##Purpose:
I'm going to keep quick notes on observations in each decade folder to organize my thoughts for when the whole thing comes together online.

##Thoughts:
When I examine the force cluster we see topic 8 is the most predominant, it appears the most, topic 9 and 5 appear the least and everything else is equally split at this time. What conclusions can be drawn from this? What topics are these? Examine.
