ID4,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,13,inform,Our latest accounts from the West Indies say that no supply from the islands either of wheat or flour can possibly be obtained from the American states in consequence of the great bounties given by his Most Christian Majesty on these articles. Our charity therefore if we have any of these articles to spare must be first extended to our own Colonies ; and we cannot be surprised particularly when we consider the present price of bread at home that no assistance can be given at present either to the French or Dutch.The crops in the island of Jamaica promise a most plentiful harvest except to the eastward which ahs generally been considered as the most productive part.By the Westmoreland just arrived from Jamaica we learn that the slaves have become mutinous to an alarming degree ever since they were made acquainted with the intended abolition of the Slave Trade.,slavery;trade;agriculture
ID5,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,20,inform,Extract of a letter from Quebec June 6.We are dreadfully alarmed at present on account of the great scarcity of flour throughout the province. Common flour sold this morning in the market at six dollars per cwt. bran from 7s. 6d. to 6s. oats 3s. per bushel and pease 20d. per bushel. There has been an account taken of the quantity of flour and wheat in this city and liberties by order of the Governor and Council and we find there is not more than will serve as ten days. They ar much worse off in the district of Montreal than we are here: We have sent them frequent supplies.Wheat which was found too bad to be shipped last year at three livres now sells at two dollars. One Merchant will make upwards of fifteen hundred pounds by this job.Government for the relief of the poor have caused to be issued by the contractor here rise at 3 d. per lb. no one to get more than a dollar's worth at a time. The day before yesterday there was delivered above a hundred pounds worth in this way.In consequence of letters by last Thursday's post from Montreal two thousand bushels of damaged wheat were shipped yesterday for that market. We have not had a grain of flour from England or the States though we hear of a cargo from New York for Montreal. The vessel was to call at New Brunswick ; and it is more than probably that people there being in great want themselves have detained her. The Government have done now what they should have done five or six months ago and then we should not be in this starving condition ; that is we are to have a proclamation to permit the importation of grain and flour from the States.My servant is just come home from the baker's where I had sent him for half a dollar's worth of bread. After watching for two hours till the bread came out of the overn he could get but eighteen-pennyworth ; three small loaves indeed weighing only two pounds each. Thirty-five shillings have been paid for ship biscuit. The Lord knows what will become of us–except Government will distribute some of the flour that is come for the troops in the Queen.Mr. Davidson one of the Council assured us on Thursday last there was not wheat and flourin the country for five weeks. He has taken a great deal of pains to be well informed on the subjuct; and to him are we indebted for the proclamation to allow the importation from the States. He stood forth alone and offered at his own expence to get an account taken of the quantities of wheat and flour in the town and liberties of Quebec and insisted on its being taken into consideration.,agriculture;prices;trade

No less than 300 ton of them were contracted for by Congress in the year 1787 to be coined at the rate of 50 ton per annum ; the contracters were also bound down to make them all of the famous Jersey copper. They are a little larger than the British halfpence. No British copper no passes in the United States;–silver and gold coins of all nations however pass cur rent.

ID7,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,20,inform,Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Bermuda to his friend in Norfolk Virginia dated April 2.By Captain Gilbert the bearer of this you will learn our distress for want of provi- sions: There has not been in the whole island one bushel of corn for sale for 16 days past. Capt. George from Baltimore brought in [?] days ago two bushels of corn which sold immeddiately at 6s. 8d. per bushel; he also brought in 360 barrels of flour common and superfine which sold at eight and nine dollars per barrel. No vessel has arrived here with provisions since Capt. George; and no vessel belonging to the island is expected to relieve us. A great number of poor people have been for ten days past obliged to live on the greens of the field. Governor Hamilton by advice of his counsel has opened the port of Bermuda to all foreign vessels whatever for thirty days to be computed from the 30th day of March laden with bread corn; or flour. He also allows for three months the importation of salted provisions from any foreign port whatever in vessels belonging to these islands. IT is said what if any foreign vessel should come here after the time permited by proclamation they will be allowed to dispose of their cargo if they can prove they set out with an intent to come here. If any vessels be ready to sail from Norfolk with provisions advise them to call at Bermuda.,agriculture;trade
ID8,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,06,inform,THE following extract from a late publication entitled A State of the present Government of the Province of Quebec will give the public some idea of the Canada Bill which has been so much talked of an procrastinated so long and at present pending in Parliament. The work we understand to be the production of Adam Lymburner Esq; set over by the province to negotiate this afair. It is remarkablewithhis former publication for its strong nervous elocution and perspicuity of reasoning.Liberty is congenial to the feelings of all mankind. The security which flows from a free constitution to both political and civil liberty contributes greatly towards bringing forth the powers of the human mind and the encouragement of the industry of people ; but no constitution can be called free where the people are not allowed to participate of the legislative authority by their representatives : This is the great criterion of freedom; and it is extremely natural for all British subjects as they know the value of it to struggle for such a valuable right. Great Britain has constantly acknoledged this prin ciple in the constitution she has granted to all her Colonies; and by that means has rendered them more flourishing and prosperous than those of o ther nations. Although the inhabitants of the province of Quebec have from the general tendency of the British government to a mild administration enjoyed a certain degree of civil liberty; yet they have been from the peculiar nature of the system of their government entirely deprived of all political liberty. A more full enjoyment of these essential privileges has been the prayer of their petitions and of those now be fore the House of commons. The objects prayed for may be reduced to the following heads:–1. An elective house of assembly or representatives of the people. 2. That the members of the legislative council receive no salaries as counsellors. 3. That the habeas corpusact and the other laws of England relating to personal libertybe made a part of the constitution. 4. That trial by jury in civil causes be likewise made part of the constitution and that nine out of twelve may return a verdict. 5. That the ancient laws and customs of Canada relative to landed property marriage settlements inheritance and dowers be continued in force in the districts or,
ID9,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,08,21,entertain,Curious Anecdote.–A few days ago a stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly Treasurer of the East India Company and desired to speak to him in private ; when the were retired the stranger said to Mr. Sibbly I am lately returned from India I have smuggled goods to the amount of about 120l. What duty have I to pay upon them? Mr. Sibbly smiled and told him That he could receive no such money without the Chairman's permission. Pray then (said the stranger) speak to him of it as soon as possible. I am resolved to pay whatever the duty is. The Company pays for the exclusive privilege of bringing India goods to Europe; the man that deprives them of any part of the advantages they hope to reap from it cannot in my opinion look upon himself as a strictly honest man. Since the stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly the Chairman had not had time to give him an answer ; the stranger notwithstanding gave him a letter including a Bank note of 30l. The sum Mr. Sibbly told him he should pay if he paid any thing.,trade
ID10,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,08,21,inform,Extract of a letter from India by the Dublin East Indiaman to Mr. William JonesWe left Patia Dec. 15 1789 and went to Decca and arrived there after a passage of 16 days. Just as we arrived there was a famine and it was really a shocking sight to behold; you could not move out of your house but the corpses lay in your way and the wild dogs and jackalls were eating them at noon-day. The Hindoos never bury their dead but burn them to ashes if they can afford it ; if not throw them into the river. I have lately seen a man brought to the river side and laid down at lowwater mark before he was dead ; and when the the tide flowed it carried him off. If a man woman or child dies at night the corpse is eaten by the morning. This I have been an eye witness of ; for as I always rode out on horseback every morning I had an opportunity of seeing more than those that did not. In the course of six months I became so much used to it that I took no notice of it.I was there when a dreadful conflagration took place and burnt upwards of seven miles without intermission and many souls perished. Now consider first an inudation; second a famine; and third a conflagration. How much the place must be distressed I leave you to think. I left Decca the 1st of December last and arrived at Calcutta after a passage through the Sunderburns (in 17 days) hearty and well thank God.,
ID11,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,08,24,persuade,The old system of sending men of rank to govern Jamaica seems to be revived and laudably too.This island is the most important possession we hold in the West Indies and is well entitled to any mark of distinction which the parent country can bestow upon it.The salary and emoluments annexed to the government of Jamaica render it the most valuable of any in the King's gift except that of Ireland.Soon after the Restoration O'Brian third Earl of Inchiquin was appointed Governor of Jamaica and died in his Government.Henry Bentinck first Duke of Portland was made Governor of this island in the reign of George I. His Grace died at Spanish Town July 4th 1736 in the 45th year of his age.The death of these two Noblemen in their government gave so bad an impression of the climate of Jamaica and the insalubrity of its air that few persons of rank and fortune have been ambitious of becoming governors of it notwith standing the brilliancy of the appointments an nexd to the situation.,colonial government
ID12,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,08,24,inform,A letter from the Bay of Honduras dated May 26 says The Spaniards who pay an annual visit to this settlement to prevent encroachments are destroying all the cultivated spots on shore alledging that the settlers are prohibited by the convention from cultivation of any kind. This will prove a temporary misfortune to the woodcutters by depriving them of the principal means of subsisting their negroes and might be productive of mischief were it not that the British Superintendant Colonel Despar with the assistance of the Calypso sloop of war keeps the woodcutters in order. This may rise the price of mahogany at home and certainly will raise provisions here.,border dispute;slavery;timber trade
ID13,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,08,28,inform,Extract of a letter form Philadelphia dated 25th May 1789.I have travelled through several of the States and see no appearance of the poverty which you hear so much boast of in Britain–every where I meet rather with extravagance. Indeed they procure too easily to be frugal in their out-givings. All the manufactured goods imported from Europe are from Britain and they cannot have goods equal in quality and price from any other place.I think I never say so many children as are in this country every town village and farm-house are full of them.–The people of this country increase like rabbits: It is supposed they double their numbers every fifteen years; but I should think they do it in a shorter period.–What a grand prospect for the sale of British goods for when so many hundreds of millions of acres of land lye [sic] idle to be granted or purchased at a small price the people of this country never will manufacture ; At present wages are high and 1000 acres of land in the back settlements may be purchased for as many [pence?].,national character;settlement description;wages

ID18,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,09,21,persuade,A short DESCRIPTION of and REMARKS upon a new State called THE WESTERN TERRITORY being one of four settled by the Americans since 1774.THAT no nation can serve the Americans with goods equal in quality and price to Britain is wha the whole world knows and from experience the most obstinate rebel American dare not deny: It is with pleasure therefore we inform our readers that the United States are paying more attention to agriculture than to manufactures–They have already laid out four new States since the beginning of their rebellion viz. Vermont Kentucky Indiana and The Western Territory.About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky ten years ago lay in forest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has been the population that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants already in each of these states. The State of Indiana was only laid off this present year in 1789 and contains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four States published in America in May last we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of them called The Western Territory; and it must rerejoice the heart of every Briton to read it and think that the settling of these countries though the Americans double their numbers every 15 or 20 years will long keep them from manufacturing and is every day opening a field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a tradesman even though wages are very high when he can for twenty pounds purchase a thousand acres of land that being the present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect that new channels of commerce will be opened and the inland parts of the Continent will require an increasing supply.–British manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that Continent and by means of a most extraordinary inland navigation will be diffused through a country more fertile more extensive than all the Thirteen United States.The Western Territory Is the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi river –north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania? south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains according to Mr. Hutchins Geographer General to the Congress 411000 square miles equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres from which he deducts forth-three millions of acres for water; there will then remain two hundred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the fed–ral government which is to be sold for the discharge of the debt owing to the United States. But a very small proportion of these lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by Congress*.On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two settlements are already commenced–one at Marietta the other at Miami.This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787 and already contains above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the Mississippi Ohio Muskingham Hockhocking Sioto Miami Wobash&c–Coal and iron mines and salt pits abound in this State; the soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour. It is exceedingly healthy pleasant and commodious–the most fertile spot of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States. The timber is tall and in great variety?Streams for mills abound here. Wheat indigo hemp and cotton thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties and fulfill the description of travellers who call it the garden of the world. It is here probably also that the center of a great empire will be fixed in some future period. It is the most centrical place for Congress to accommodate themselves at. No country is better stocked with wild game of every kind; herds of deers elks bears &c fill the extensive meadows of thie country?turkies geese swans and partridges &c. are innumerable. The rivers are excellently stored with fish and almost all navigable for small sloops.In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30000 persons; and when they acquire a certain degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into States.Rejoice O Britons! that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you and you only!* No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives for which Congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum.,Native Americans;trade;agriculture;settlement description
ID19,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,10,02,inform,There are no less than 130 women going out in the transports to Botany Bay; among the female convicts destined for this settlement there was one so beautiful that it was thought a pity to send her abroad and she is therefore preferred for home cultivation.,
ID20,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,10,09,inform,[Continued from our last.] Carlisle July 29.ON Saturday last between three and four o'clock P. M. happened the most violent hurricane pest or thunder storm (for we are at a lost to determine its proper name) that was ever known in this borough or its vicinity. We can conceive of nothing but an earthquake that could be attended with more alarming circumstances. The cloud from the west or rather a number of clouds of a lowering aspect furiously agitated broken and seemingly ready to fall– attracted the attention and prepared the mind in some measure for what was to follow. The lightening appeared to those who were at a distance remarkably red and seemed to flash from the cloud to the earth and back again in quick succession or some time as to appear one sheet of flame. This might have had a great effect on the air at some miles distance from town to set it in rapid motion especially when pressed down by a heavy cloud suddenly falling towards the earth. A very considerable quantity of hail fell; and the rain was so abundant that it seemed as thrown from buckets and being carried along and dashed against every opposing object by a most impetuous wind darkened the air in such a manner that all surrounding objects seemed lost in night. The storm threatened to lay the whole town in ruins with such irresistible force did the column of air move on: happily however the damages were much less than apprehended. The The new brick house belonging to the Rev. Dr. Davidson being an an elevated spot near the west end of the town and lying directly in the line of march of this powerful column was the first sufferer; all the parts of the building above the square were suddenly borne off and a great part of the roof was carried over Mr. Paton's house which stood at a small distance on the east striking it forcibly and injuring it greatly in its ways and fell on the adjoining lot. Mr. Paton's house is left in much the same condition as the Doctor's. After injruing some smaller buildings in its course to the eastward the next elevated object to which it pointed its fury was the presbyterian church in the certain of town–a building of uncommon solidity calculated it was thought to stand for ages admist all the war of the elements. About a fourth part however of the roof of the north side was carried off with the weighty cornice and thrown to the ground at some hundred yards distance on the east side of the open square which is in the centre of this borough. After leaving the town it beat its course to the public buildings and greatly injured that range nearest the town. Many fences in the neighbourhood which were in the line of its direction were also thrown down; but how far it extended or what damages the farmers may have sustained we have not yet learned. Let it however not be forgotten that dreadful as the scene was through the good providence of God not a single life was lost or any personal injury worth mentioning received and the buildings it is hoped will soon be restored to as good a state as they were in before.,weather

ID22,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,10,09,inform,Philadelphia Aug. 5.We are happy in informing our readers that in the memory of the oldest man among us a more plentiful year has not been known than the present. Neither mildew nor fly has affected the wheat; the grain is heavy and full and in large quantities. The other grains are likewise plentiful and of an excellent quality. Such distinguished favours call for the gratitude of the inhabitants of the United Sates to the great Author of Nature; especially when these blessings of nature are connected in the same year with deliverance from anarchy and with the establishment of a wise free and just government.,agriculture

Gorham and Phelps–That they were met by Mr. Phelps and the principal inhabitants of Conadoque four miles from that place and conducted into town –That they were highly gratified with the treatment they received and with the manner in which they had disposed of their lands.–The gentleman further informs that there is now about 3000 inhabitants in the above county and that the land is of a good quality.,Native Americans

ID25,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,11,20,inform,We have been favoured by a friend with the following extract of a letter from Grenada by the last West India Packet.A Mr. C– has just arrive here from Martinico where he left the white inhabitants in arms. The negroes there had conceived an idea that the Parliament of England had set the English negroes free ; where upon those on several of the most considerable estates assembled together to the amount of 4000 and retired to the mountains declaring they would no longer be slaves ; saying that they had as good a right to be free as the negroes in the English islands. What has been the event is unknown ; but some reports say that they had arms and had resisted the military and the militia ; and that 400 had been taken and condemned to die. It is a little singular that such an alarming spirit of discontent should first make its appearance among the French negroes if they are (as has been assented by several writers) so much more civilized so much better treated than those of the English islands. God knows what bloodshed may soon follow from the mistaken humanity of some well meaning but ill informed leaders among you.,slavery;slave rebellion

In the evening of their arrival before they had taken their station as a guard a number of Indians rushed into Mr. Chenoweth's house killed two of the soldiers and three of Mr. Chenoweth's children and tomahawked and scalped his wife leaving her on the floor for dead– Mr. Chenoweth (who had his arm broke by the savages) with the rest of the men made their escape.–There was one of Mr. Chenoweth's children sick in a chamber and it is reported she never heard any thing of the dreadful massacre; but next morning crawling down stairs she was inexpressibly shocked at the sight of a beloved parent almost breathless–Mr. Chenoweth returned next day to his house and carried his wife to a neighbouring plantation where they are both likely to recover and what is remarkable she wants to return to her own house.–The savages have been very troublesome in this neighbourhood. –A small company are gone to White River to extirpate 80 or 90 Indians who as spies have informed have upwards of 300 horses &c. at that place.,Native Americans

ID31,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,11,27,persuade,What mighty contests rise from trivial things;That the present Revolution in France is a consequence of the Revolution in America cannot admit of a doubt. The American Revolution originated in Adams a very insignificant Bostonian. Not that this Adams had the least expectation of American independence when he fomented the opposition to the stamp-act; indeed no human wisdom could possibly have foreseen the subsequent folly and imprudence of the British administration and its obsequious Parliament. An Administration so totally destitute of common sense so totally ignorant of every princple of sound policy no nation ever beheld. Adams had the sagacity to avail himself of such despicable policies.–Fortunately for the American cause the Generals that were sent from England were of congenial abilities with the Minister and the Americans themselves were surprised at the facility with which they acquired their independence. –Yet all the blunders of the British administration and the miserable conduct of the British Generals would hardly have been sufficient to emancipate America notwithstanding her extreme weakeness without the assistance of France; and this assistance depended entirely on Dr. Franklin being driven to Paris by the fatal-philippic of a certain great lawyer. Such therefore is the chain of concurrent circumstances that hath overturned the French monarch. If the British minister had possessed common sagacity–if he could have distinguished a general from a corporal; if Franklin had been treated with common civility America would have remained a British colony and France an absolute monarch for ages yet to come.,revolution
ID32,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,11,inform,Mr. Ephraim Daniel of Baker's-row Mileend received the following letter from a friend in Holland last week:Sir your friend L–y who is just come here from the East Indies desires me to inform you that your unfortunate relation who left you with the transports for Botany Bay was well in February last. He has settled at Port Jackson and has leave to teach the children of some of your nation to read and write in your own way. The place is much improved since you ahve had any letters form it as there was no person without a habitation and being in some order when he left it. Except wearing apparel very little is wanting but business ; but you may thank the Dutch at Batavia for it as they have brought several useful things there. The last crops of corn and the garden grounds were in very good condition : and what makes the settlement more convenient one of the people who came in the first fleet makes all forts of earthn ware for use and ornament as the clay is equally good as that of Delft or elsewhere. He was surprised to see so many people without hats or shoes and houses without windows and full of wicker and rush furniture which is used in th eplace of almost every thing else. If the smiths had a plentiful supply of coal and iron hardly any utensils would be wanting. Your nephew has two children and says all that are born there are very healthy and more born than are buried or executed of grown people. The Christians Church was quite finished before he came away ; and he thinks if there were enough of your people they might have a place to themselves. The farthest of the lines was seldom visited by the savages ; and it was reported when he came away that as soon as more troops and a new Governor comes over they would go farther than ever up the country when some valuable discovers are expected to be made ; they have a gum which may be used for gum arabic which is veyr useful. He expects several of your people will go from Batavia to settle there very soon ; and wonders a way for sending old clothes is not yet found out.

The plot was not discovered till five o'clock in the evening when a negro belonging to an old lady stung with remorse on thinking that he must murder the woman who brought him up form a child disclosed it to her. The Troops being thereupon assembled 40 of the negroes were taken armed with a hanger and a long knife the insturments which were in a few hours to have put a period to the existence of upwards of 5000 people. All the inhabitants have been under arms ever since as they are afraid the negroes will attemp to release the 40 who are in gaol.,slavery;slave rebellion

To my utter astonishment my rustic landlord did not take in own newspaper; so there was I stuck down with my friend in the country–knowing no more of what passed in town than if I had been in Lapland. Intending every day should be my last I went on without ordering your or any other paper till two months had passed away at which period I returned to town. And there Sir I was quite a new man and just as if I had dropped down from the clouds. Every day I heard people talking of occurrences of which I knew nothing : Revolutions in France by Fishwomen ; and battles in Flanders against the Emperor who I thought was fighting against the Turks.But even this was not the most distressing–for one day meeting a friend I inquired very cordially after his wife who I found a few days afterwards had eloped just before with another gentleman ; and meeting with a lady I inquired kindly for her sister who I found had departed to the other world a fortnight before.On this account I never will stir again out of the world unless your paper goes along with me. I hold a newspaper to be a kind of viaticum with which every man should be provided and which become the more necessary the further we remove from town It. is the only way to keep pace with what is going on every day in the fashionable or literary world–and to prevent talking about dead friends or wives that have absconded.In short Sir a newspaper is my creed–and never will I again travel without my faith along with me : having fully experienced the unpleasantness of being sent back into the world as ignorant as if I had been born again–I hereby give notice– That if an hottentot friend of mine invites me who does not take in your paper or some other– I will not visit him.DICK DESPERATE.,humour;newspapers
ID42,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,14,inform,Account of a singular Sect called Shaking QuakERS in America.IN the United States of America there are some Jews and various denomications of Christians –as Roman Catholics Lutherans Presbyterians Congregationalists Baptists Quakers Dunkers Moravians Deists Methodists Newlights Sandimanians Universalists and Shaking Quakers; all of whom are allowed to perform religious worship accoridng to the dictates of their consciences.The Shaking Quakers are a new sects that sprang up about the year 1769 : an old woman called the Elect Lady with twelve disciples all of which were said to be Europeans were the founders of this new mode of worship ; they drew thousands of people after them who pretended they were visited with power from on high to work miracles heal the sick raise the dead cast out devils and speak in unknown languages.This Lady risided in the north-westerly part of the State of New York where she began to instil her tenets into some of the people there:– afterwards she rambled from place to place promulgating her religion and gaining proselytes in New England and elsewhere:–she engrossed the kingdom of heaven to herself and followers to the seculsion of all others.She pretended her mission was immediately from heaven;–that she travelled in pain for her elect –could speak in seventry-two unknown languages in which she conversed with those that had departed this life–that there had not been a true church upon earth since the days of the Apostles until her's was erected–that both the living and the dead must be saved in by and through her –must confess their sins unto her and procure her parson or they could not be saved;–that that she gathered her church from both earth and hell as every person that had died since the time of the Apostles until her church was set up was damned and that they were ocntinually making intercession to her for salvation which was the occasion of her talking to them in those unknown tongues.Those that entered into her church were obliged to confess their sins and deliver up their jewels rings necklaces buckles watches &c. to be disposed of as she thought fit.It has been reported that some of these confessions proved very beneficial; for some of her church members owned they had stolen things that had been laid to innocent persons.When these people carry on their worship they pretend to praise the Lord by singing dancing jumping turning round falling down tumbling &c. and in the mean time some will be trembling groaning sighing and sobbing: whilst others are preaching praying exhorting &c. others will be clapping their hands shouting hallowing screaming and making such a hideous noise that it may be heard at a great distance and will often affrighten the spectators.They often dance three hours without intermission and when any of them are tired of praising the Lord that way they are whipped by others to make the worship go on briskly. They dance till they are much emaciated ; the young women grow pale appear like ghosts or apparitions or like deserters from a church-yard –if I may use the sailor's phrase.They make no use of the Eucharist or of water baptism in their churchs; are averse to wars fighting and swearing ; they use the plain language and cry–yea and nay instead of yes and no: but the other Quakers do not approve of all their tenets.At particular times they labour very hard at their respective occupations and are very careful that no time is spent in idleness.They pretend they hold a correspondence with the saints and angels and that they frequently see and converse with the spirits of their departed friends.Many of them refuse to be with their wives because they suppose they are part of the hundred and forty and four thousand mentioned in the Revelations that were redeemed from the earth and were not defiled with women.They hold that they have already been made partakers of the first resurrection and that on them the second death will have no power.They do not allows the instrumental music in their churches because they suppose it was ceremonial and is abolished;–but pretend that they carry on their worship by the immediate power and influence of the Holy Ghost and that they have scripture warrents for their practice a[?]– Sing unto God–Praise the Lord in the dance; –O clap your hands all ye people;–Shout on to God;–Make a joyful noise;–Fall down before the Lords&c.,religion

ID45,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,18,inform,Martinique Oct. 6.The disturbances in this island are so far from having abated that they seem daily to gain additional force. The French General after the and endeavoured to bring over a part of the military to his side against the people : He began with subalterns several of whom took a certain oath of attachment which he administered to them ; but when he came to the Major that officer declined saying he had already engaged himself on the side of the people. Incensed at this reply he reviled him in very opprobrious terms and at last laid his cane upon him !Frustrated in his attempts upon the infantry he made his next application to the regiment of artillery but with as little success. They informed him that themselves and Culverins were stationed there for the protection of the people and for them only should be used.Driven to the last shift his distress suggested the sorry expedient of having recourse to the people of colour who here form a considerable corps. By a small dose of flattery these people so readily to be caught by a little seeming attention promised to stand by him ; and did so as long as they usually stand firm to any thing–that is till their fears for their own persons became an object of more weighty concern–they then abandoned him.The humiliating familiarities to which he descended to this motley rabble were truly disgusting. He embraced them; called them his enfans and cher amis and practised all the dirty condescensions which those only who are conversant in the praise-worthy art of cajoling can form any conception of.The effect of this conduct was as might be expected insolence–one of this banditti presumed to strike a grenadier–this incensed both the military and the peopl–the consequence was their doughty leader was laid hold of when his trusty defenders left him to his fate. He wa sput into confinement and had the pleasure of beholding from the windows of his prison him whom he had inspired with the insolent temerity to strike White suspended on a gibbet.The inhabitants of St. Pierre then assembled to confer on the measures to be taken on this occasion when ten deputies were chosen to bring the deposed Commander to that part of the island for trial and twelve Judges were chosen to preside at that very important tribunal.Thus stood matters on Thursday last at which time a rumour prevailed that the Marquis de Bouillee had suffered death by the extraordinary and ingenious method of being put between two planks and severed in pieces by a cross-cut saw.,military;revolution
ID46,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,18,inform,Extract of a letter from Philadelphia Aug. 23.Congress is still sitting at New York and from the multiplicity of business before them there is no likelihood of the session's soon closing. We are curious to know what foreigners will sayof our new commercial arrangements. Among ourselves there is but one opinion and that is faavourable. o our own vessels a preference is undoubtedly due; and among foreign vessels and merchandise there is no discrimination in our import and tonnage acts every nation being on the same footing. With respect to the duties themselves they could not be laid lower considering the demand of supplies which the Committee appointed to give in an estimate state at upwards of eight millions of dollars.Accustomed to disappointment in hopes of improvement in politics and commerce we feel a reluctance to entertaining very sanguine wishes. Yet appearances encourage the expecttion of the f–deral government's acting with the energy and effect that will give it respectability. The prejudices and animosities created by the late contest are gradually dying away ; and to the idleness and dissipation flowing from the same source industry has in a great degree succeeded. A progress has also been made in manufactures of various kinds that was not expected ; and the persevering in them affords a strong presumption of those concerned deriving advantage.Throughout the union the public opinion on matters of government has of late experienced rapid changes. Vice President Adams in his highly esteemed work has fully demonstrated the absurdity of democracy and the superior excellence of a mix form such as that of Britain. His deductions from premises admitted as just have abated much of the popular aversion to monarchy ; and as every thing matures quickly in our transatlantic soil it would not surprise many were United America to have a sovereign earin the next century.In no one instance has our new admnistration given general satisfaction more than in their conduct towards the Indians. The interests of those unfortunate people will be studiously attended to ; and they will be effectually protected against the lawless violence of the individuals or States who wished to wrest their lands from them. This determination is dictated by policy as well humanity ; for it is now become the interest of the States to check by every means short of violence the erratic disposition of their citizens who when removed to the wilds beyond the mountains cannot be regarded as of any value in a political view.,Native Americans;politics

ID48,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,18,persuade,The Minister is now said to be employed in drawing up two plans which will give rise to very warm debates in Parliament : one is for settling a commercial arrangement between Great Britain and Ireland ; the other for giving a constitution to Canada. In feeling the former the Minister will have to contend with strong commercial prejudices; in the latter he will have to encounter religious principles. The British settlers in Canada are comparatively few in number. The great bulk of the Canadians are the descendants of French and are Roman Catholics. The former are Protestants.Fleaury in france and Walpole in England were not fonder of peace than Mr. Pitt. Conquests may be made by war but consequence and wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system if the first commercial nation in the world.Besides these considerations the grand secret has been discovered since the present Minister came into power that the best riddance England ever had was of her American Colonies ; because by this means she becomes thoroughly collected at home to oppose every foreign power without the expence and blood of supporting the Americans at the same time that they cannot do without BRitish manufactures in one line or another.Thus they are under the necessity of protecting themselves at the same time that like the rest of Europe they are obliged to resort to our superior mercantile market.Application has been lately made to the Lords of the Treasury for an order on the Bank to issue some of the new silver coin in aid of the present want of silver for circulation the scarcity of which is much felt by retail traders in particular.,trade;Anglo-American relations;religion

ID50,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,21,persuade,The following philosophical facts lead us to presume that the winter now setting in will prove a mild one : It has been constantly remarked that when this season commences early and with severity in Newfoundland and the more northern part of North America it becomes extremely rigorous and of a proportionate continuance there. When in the above climate the winters have been severe they have invariably been mild with us and vice versa. Now the ships which sailed from Newfoundland the beginning of October last saw the hills already covered with snow. There is still another argument in favour of a mild winter with us. Previously to the setting in of a severe one nature in her bounty has been always observed to have provided an uncommon store of wild briar fruits as a nourishment to the smaller birds who would otherwise perish a vast carpet of snow spreading itself over the ground so as to prevent their coming at the worms &c. on which they are accustomed to feed. The present season the store of these wild fruits is extremely moderate.,weather

ID54,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,04,inform,Extract of a letter from Portsmouth Nov. 23.The convicts already arrived at this port from Newfoundland are near fourscore in number; a few others are expected. These unhappy wretches are almost destitute of every sort of covering and some of them are labouring under sickness and infirmity. Their story is accurateas follows: About the middle of last June this miserable class of beings to the amount of 102 men and boys and twelve women all of whom were convicts were embarked at Dublin on board the Duke of Leinster transport the owners of which who are Dublin merchants contracted with the Government of Ireland for carrying the convicts to the North American States.After the ship had been at sea five weeks part of which was foul weather the provision is said to have fallen short ; the master of the transport Capt. Harrison accordingly stood in for Newfoundland and lay-to till night; when he disembarked at Bull's Bay and a little distance from it with as much secrecy as possible his desperate freight.To prevent this proceeding being too early early known he landed with them provision for the immediate supply of their wants and bore away with a press of sail. The hungry victims lived for three days in a state of warfare quarrelling about their food ; the strongest beat the weak and over a cask of rank butter or beef there was for a time as severe fighting as if a kingdom had been at stake.They reached the town of St. John's on the 20th of July ; and exhibited the most appaling procession ever seen in that country : the inhabitants had immediate councils; and the military and navy co-operating a place of security was fixed upon at a distance from the town and they were lodged ; here under a guard.Here the Irish howl was nightly sung in full chorus and the centinels were frequently frighted with the noise while on their posts. A battle or two every half hour kept them festive all day; and when the provision supplied to them by the inhabitants was lessening they broke away and laid hold of every thing that was eatable without enquiring whether it had an owner.Some of these poor wretches were anxious to be received into the service of the inhabitants and probably might have reformed if so fostered. But all of them have a claim to the charity of this country for that supply of raiment which is necessary to guard them against the inclement weather.,transportation

By Mr.Ledyard a celebrated traveller.I have always remarked that women in all countries are civil obliging tender and humane; that they are ever inclined to be gay and cheerful timorous and modest : and that they do not hesitate like men to perform a generous action. Not haughty not arrogant not supercilious they are full of courtesy and fond of society ; more liable in general to err than man but in general also more virtuous and performing more good actions than he. To a woman whether civilized or savage I never addressed myself in the language of decency and friendship without receiving a decent and friendly answer. With men it has been otherwise.In wandering over the barren plains of inhos- pitable Denmark through honest Sweden and fro- zen Lapland rude and churlish Finland unprin- cipled Russia and the widespread regions of the wandering Tartar ; if hungry dry cold wet or sick the women have ever been friendly to me and uniformly so ; and to add to this virtue (so worthy the appellation of benevolence) these actions have been performed in so free and so kind a manner that if I was dry I drank the sweetest draught and if hungry I eat the coarse morsel with a double relish.,

They were covered to the President of the United States of America.[From what appeared in our paper of Friday last (see Glasgow Intelligence p. 424) and what is mentioned above it seems very probable that the affair of Nootka Sound had been a preconcerted scheme between the Americans and Spaniards as Capt.

Seated on the banks of the great river Mississippi far to the westward of all the other states they can either navigate northerly to the lakes or southerly to the Spanish settlements on the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and carry on a lucrative trade with the Indians.

Thus from the most distressed situation to rise to opulence and independence ina few years must excite admiration.Agriculture at present seems to be the peculiar province of American industry from whence wealth will flow into every part of that vast country as it abounds in large tracts of rich land level grounds with a deep soil and extended savannahs; while to the northward the fisheries and shipbuilding amply compensate for the want of an equal fertility; and though not so abundant in coin yet the provinces produce the finest meadows form whence a provision trade will be every year increasing.

He made the proposal to her as his friend has directed and the young gentlewoman who had no subsistence but from a cross old aunt who gave her a great deal of uneasiness accepted it. A ship bound for the West Indies was then fitting out at Bristol ; the gentlewoman went on board the same together with the bales of goods being well provided with all necessaries and particularly with a certificate in due form and indorsed by the correspondent. She was also included in the invoice the last article of which ran thus : Item a maid of 21 years of age of the quality shape and conditioned as per order ; as appears by the affadavits and certificates she has to produce. Writings which were thought necessary to so exact a man as the future husband were an extract from the parish register ; a certificate of her character signified by the curate ; an attestation of her neighbours setting forth that she had for the space of three years lived with an old aunt who was intolerably peevish and that she had not during all that time given her said aunt the least occasion of complaint.

At the same time she gave him his correspondent's letter on the back of which was wrote The bearer of this is the spouse you ordered me to send you.

ID85,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,12,13,inform,THE INDIANS.IT is our wish in imitation of other newswritters to give now and then an account of such new publications as deserve the attention of the public; but in a paper pubished only twice a week where so much naturally occurs under the article of temporary news it is but seldom we can find room for this purpose:–when however any ting remarkable appears in the literary world we never fail to notice it although it may not be in our power to give an extensive and critical account of its excellencies. We take up the pen with real pleasure at present to announce the publication of a tragedy intitled THE INDIANS the reputed offspring of a learned Professor in this University. The great applause with which this play was received when performed at Richmond Theatre has raised the expectations of those who were not present at the performance to the highest pitch; and we think we may take upon ourselves to assert that upon perusing it even their highest expetations will not be disappointed.– The plot of the piece is taken from a well known story published at the end of a volum of poems written by the same gentleman. In the choice of a plot where so many dramatic writers of respectable talents have erred our author is peculiarly happy. He ha strictly observed the advice of Horace:Denique sit quid vis simplex dumtaxat et unum.It is simple and yet it does not disgust by an appearance of nakedness.–It is one for the complaints of Maraino and the return of Oniyo form a beginning; the machinations of Yerdal and Neidan to prevent their meeting a middle; and defeat of those arts an end which combined wake up a compleat and connected whole. In the delineation of character the author has on al every occasion attended to the quid quemque decent–there are hoever some few parts which the critic halts to consider but which amidst so many beauties he blushes to censure–Some lines for instance in the character of Ononthio do not strike us at first as strictly natural. Is so much humanity found inthe breast of an Inan Sachem as to prompt him to spare a victim about to be destroyed accoridng to the custom of the country; that victim a captive of war and not only so but a Briton who has been fighting against his coun- trymen amongst whom was his only son whom he bleived slain? Would he exert himself so much in favour of a stranger and a foe at the risk of displeasing the village and consequently of losing his power? Or is it likely that he would have greater influence with the superstitious crowd than he who was deemed of skill to bend to his purpose the demons that sway the fortune of mankind?–Another question concenring Ononthio and we leave him. Is it consistent with the phlisophic firmness of the Sachem so to despair on receiving news of his son's death as to declare that he should know no comfort but to die? or is it consistent with his humanity to leave Maraino at such a period of distress when she most stood in need of his kind offices?–The first and best supported character in the piece is that of Maraino. Her mind seems intended as the seat of every amiable virtue. Her grateful reverence of Ononthio her unaffected piety and her humanity in intfering to save an unknown captive from death are pleasing ??? which give ??? an insight into her nature. In the breast of Mariano every thing is subordinate to her love for Onaiyo: this leading feature in her caracter is properly kept in view during the course of the piece. But even in this master-piece the author has perhaps once deviated a little from nature. The sentiments Maraino utters during the conversation with Sydney in the fifth act are rather those of a Phiosopher and Divine than a young creature the chorus of whole heart are tuned to the sweetest strains of tenderness and love. Can she who had lately discovered a long lost brother talk so coldly in his presence; Can she who had so lately heard of the safety of an adored-husband so entirely banish his imag from her mind as to converse on matters so indifferent? Can the gentle Maraino become the cold moralist?–With this one exception the part of which we are speaking is finely drawn and highly intersting.–The language of the piece is every where elegant and in many places where the sentiment requires it sublime. The uathor has requently dignified his verse by the introduction of obsolete words; this in general produces a good effect–but there is a danger of using them too often and of chusing them too ancient. it is a dangerous and difficult talk where all is so excellent to refer to any particular passage of scene as deserving most notice: it requires no small degree of taste and judgement. If there is any preference to be given it is perhaps to that scene in the 2d act where Onaiyo gives an account of the battle at Quebec; and the scene in the 4th act where Maraino is prompted by Neidan to slay her brother–who proves his innocence by the production of her husband's belt the sight of which draws an elegant speech from the enraptured fair. This scene however would be improved did it conclude with something more apt to the joyful moment than the solemn sounds of Ononthio: a speech excellent in itself and containing a very fine sentiment Sed nunc non erat his locus.–Upon the whole the tragedy upon which we have guided by impartiality spoken so freely is in our opinion far superior to most of those plays which have appeared of late years:–it is devoid of bombast:–it is nature–and she must inevitably please.,theatre;Native Americans

In a second engagement they were likewise victorious having nearly killed as many. On account of which Sinclair thought proper to retreat; and the last accounts state the Indians having divided themselves into small parties had so harrassed him that he was obliged to leave the wounded in the field–Sinclair lost his artillery a cohorn and grass-hopper.

These are facts so well ascertained that there does not remain the least doubt of them:They may be attended with very serious and important consequences to the province as I dare say all will be imputed to the British for supplying these Indians with arms and ammunition.– In short I would not be surprized to hear of an American army raising to attack this country. * The loss is here specified but other letters differing in number we shall only say the estimate in general does not appear considerable.,Native Americans

ID90,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,23,inform,CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.The following account of the inhabitants of this settlement is given by a late traveller.The education of youth has hitherto been very much neglected: the government never hit upon any successful plan for the establishment of public schools; and the individual had no other ambition but that of qualifying his sons by writing and accounts to become servants of the Company. This body of merchants had a number of persons in their employ who were very ill paid. Their salaries indeed were sufficient to afford them a bare subsistence ; but it ta citly allowed them to negotiate for themselves: the consequence of such a conduct was that each became a kind of petty dealer. Each had his little private shop in some corner of his house. The most paltry articles were in the list of their commodities for sale ; and those who ranked high in government and assumed a string of full-founding epithets to their names felt no sore of indignity in retailing the produce of their gardens ; not indeed avowedly but through the medium of their slaves. In fact the minds of every class the Governor the Clergy the F[?]l and the Secretary of the Court of Justice excepted were wholly bent on trade. Knopman or merchant was a title that conferred rank at the Cape to which the military even aspired. On this subject the ideas of the Dutch differ widely from those of the Chinese who have degraded the merchant into the very lowest order of their society.That portion of the day not employed in the concerns of trade is usually devoted to the gratification of the sensual appetite. Few have any taste for reading and none for the cultivation of the fine arts.–They have no kind of public amusements except occasional balls ; nor is there much social intercourse but by family parties; which usually consist of card playing or dancing. Money-matters and merchandize engross their whole conversation : yet none are opulent though many in easy circumstances. There are no beggars in the whole colony and but a few who are objects of public cha rity. The subsistence for these is derived from the interest of a fund established out of the church superfluities from alms donations and collections made after divine service and not from any tax laid upon the public. Except indeed a few colonial assessments for the repairs of the streets and public works the inhabitants of the Cape have little drawback on their profits on the produce of their labour.It has been the remark of most travellers that the ladies of the Cape are pretty lively and good humoured ; possessing little of that phlegmatic temper which is a principal trait in the national character of the Dutch. The difference in the manners and appearance of the young men and the young women in the same family is inconceivably great. The former are clumsy in their shape awkward in in their carriage and of an unsocial disposition; whilst the latter are generally of a small delicate form below the middle size of easy and unaffected manners well dressed and fond of social intercourse; an indulgence in which they are seldom restrained by their parents and which they as seldom turn to abuse. They are here indeed less dependent on and less subject to the caprice of parents than else where. Primogeniture entitles to no advantage; but all the children male and female share alike in the family property. No parent can disinherit a child without assigning on proof on at least of the fourteen reasons enumerated in the Justinian Code.By the law of the colony a community of all property both real and personal is supposed to take place on the marriage of two person unless the contrary should be particularly provided against by solemn contract made before marriage. Where no such contract exists the children on the death of either parent are entitled to that half of the joint property which was supposed to belong to the deceased and which cannot be withheld on application after they are come of age.It is but justice to the young females of the Cape to r emark that many of them have profited much more than could be expected from the limited means of education that the place affords. In the better families most of them are taught music and some have acquired a tolerable degree of execution. Many understand the French language and some have made great proficiency in the English. They are expert at the needle and all kinds of lace knotting and tambour work and in general make up their own dresses following the prevailing fashion of England brought from time to time by the female passengers bound to India from whom they may be said to Catch the manners living as they riseNeither are the other sex while boys deficient in vivacity or talent ; but for want of the means of a proper education to open their minds and excite in them a desire of knowledge they soon degenerate into the common routine of eating smoaking [sic] and sleeping. Few of the male inhabitants associate with the English except such as hold employments under the Government. This backwardness may be said to be owing in part to the different habits of the two nations and partly perhaps to the reluctance that a vanquished people must always feel in mixing with their conquerors.,society;gender;national characteristics;education

ID92,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,14,inform,As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at the opening of the Congress of the United States at New York Nov. 6 1792 gives an impartial account of the situation of tha country we are persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers.Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of RepresentativesIT is some abatement of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally I am not able to add to it information that the Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our western frontier have terminated:You will I am persuaded learn with no less concern than I communicate it that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the further effusion of blood–to arrest the progress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable purposes:–In making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the event or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable; to ascertain unequivocally that such is the case.A detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thus far will I trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of some of them indeed is still depending; but a favorable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by anything that has yet happened.In the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will I presume be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased.It must add to your concern to be informed that besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it.A part of the Cherokees known by the name of Chickamagas inhabiting five villages on the Tennessee River have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements.It was hoped that the treaty of Holston made with the Cherokee Nation in July 1791 would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter. The information which has been received on this subject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive precautions only have been enjoined and observed.It is not understood that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever on the part of the United States or their citizens is even alleged as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter.I have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete and pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable.In looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be found inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year. This however will be better ascertained in the course of the session; and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of hostilities.I can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory–To enable by competent rewards the employment of qualified and trusty persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable.The prosperous state of our revenue has been intimated–This would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the United States. These impediments have lessened and are lessened in local extent; and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the law appears to be progressive.But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in certain quarters I judged a special interposition on my part proper and advisable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto.Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders. And Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend upon me shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws. In fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of the Government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens.I can not forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the supreme court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws considerations rise out of the structure of the system which in some cases tend to relax their efficacy. As connected with this subject provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the courts of the United States and a supplementary definition of offenses against the constitution and laws of the union and of the punishment for such offenses will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention.Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary. It would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your consideration of the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations and other infractions of the law of nations which furnishes just subject of complaint might endanger our peace with them. And in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose which takes place if not renewed at the close of the present session.In execution of the authority given by the legislature measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our mint; others have been employed at home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them.The regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the principles of our national coinage as being essential to their due operation and to order in our money concerns will I doubt not be resumed and completed.It is represented that some provisions in the law which establishes the Post-Office operate in experiment against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country.–Should this upon due enquiry be found to be the fact a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and information will I doubt not lead to the application of a remedy.The adoption of a constitution for the state of Kentucky has been notified to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order.It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for three millions of florins–one at Antwerp at the annual interest of four and one-half per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of all charges.–The rates of these loans and the circumstances under which they have been made are confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad.Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers according to the provision made during the last session has been embraced.Gentlemen of the House of RepresentativesI entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effec tual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved to the government –no measure can be more desirable whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation.Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made of the Bank of the United States pursuant to the section of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made.Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and I doubt not will engage your early attention.Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of RepresentativesI content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you.Various temporary laws will expire during the present session. Among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes will merit particular notice.The results of your common deliberations hitherto will I trust be productive of solid and durable advantages to our constituents; such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment upon which under Divine Providence materially depend their union their safety and their happiness.Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivation of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils.,Native Americans;political speeches;currency;foreign relations

ID315,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,01,inform,Yesterday forenoon arrived at Spithead the Lord Dorcester merchantman Edward Howe master bound from Halifax for London.In this ship came six Cherokee Chiefs of the first rank one of them born in England.As soon as their arrival was announced in form Sir Andrew Douglas Commander of the Alcide of 74 guns sent his barge to bring them ashore to Portsmouth; and upon landing they went to Bradley's the crown Inn.The object of these Chiefs coming to this country is to endeavour to form a connection with the English Government in order to attempt the reduction of Mexico near which place they have 20000 men in arms and can raise 30000 more in a short time.The Cherokees have menaced that country for these last three years and are favoured by great number of the inhabitants in the Spanish settlements; should they therefore procure respectable assistance from England the New World will be a certain conquest and open a source of trade and wealth to this nation that will more than compensate for the loss of America and the expence of attaining that grand object.These Indian Chiefs are dressed in the habit of their country with their faces painted in an extraordinary manner. They waited on Colonel Trigge of the 12th regiment of foot and some other officers of distinction. One of them who was born in England named Bowles speaks English indifferently well and is extremely communicative. He went over to America with his parents who were in the army when a boy and by some means strayed to an Indian camp where he was most hospitably received and afterwards rais ed to the highest honours of their nation.The Cherokee Chiefs are expected in town this day to deliver their ??? to Mr. Secretary Grenville.,Native Americans
ID316,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,07,inform,MONDAY JAN. 7. By the Fanny Capt. Bryen arrived in twenty four days from New York we have American papers of which we give the following important intelligence:–It is an undoubted truth (Strange as it may appear) that the Baron D'Carondolet Governor of Louisiana and Governor O'Neal of Pensaco la have opened the shores of the King of Spain in West-Florida to the Creeks and Cherokees and delivered them arms and ammunition in abundance advising and stimulating them to go to war against the frontier inhabitants of the United States and that quickly that now or never was the time while the United States were engaged with the northern tribes.On the 30th of September about midnight John Buchanan's station four miles south of Nashville) at which sundry families had collected and fifteen gunmen) was attacked by a part of Creeks and Lower Cherokees supposed to consist of three of our hundred. Their approach was suspected by the running of cattle that had taken fright at them and upon examination they were found rapidly advancing within ten yards of the gate and from the place and distance they received the first fire from the man who discovered them John M'Rocy. They immediately returned the fire and continued a very heavy and constant firing upon the station blockhouses surrounded with a stockade for an hour and were repulsed with considerable loss without injuring man woman or child in the station.During the whole time of the attack the Indians were never more distant than ten yards from the Block House and often in large numbers close round the lower walls attempting to put fire to it. One ascended the roof with a torch where he was shot and falling to the ground renewed his attempts to fire the bottom logs and was killed. The Indians fired 30 balls through a port hole of the over???ing which lodged in the roof in the circumference of the bat and those sticking in the walls on the outside are innumerable.Undoubted advices have been received that as early at the 18th of September as many as 500 Creeks passed the Tennessee and the lower Cherokee towns and below as on their way they decared to make war on Cumberland–and that they were joined by about 100 Cherokees of those towns.–This must have been the party that attacked Buchanan's station. Dreadful havoc was expected but it is now hoped that the check they have received will induce them to return without making further attempts upon that settlement.On the 3d instant. Black's Block House on the head of Crooked Creek (a branch of Little River) at which there was a serjeant's command of Cape Crawford's company was attacked by surprise about an hour and a half in the night by a party of Indians commanded by a Cherokee of Will's Town called the Tail a brother of the Bench and Talohteske consisting of 3 other Cherokees and 5 Creeks.James Paul was killed in the knife and George Morse and Robert Sharp at a fire on the outside and John Shankland wounded 3 horses were killed and 7 taken off.These are the fruits of the advise of the Baron D'Carrondolet and Governor O'Neal; and it is due to Mr. Paton their chief instrument to add he has well acted his part!!!We hear from Fayetteville (North Carolina) that on Tuesday the 23d of October last a fire broke out in that town owing to the negligence of a small negro girl which consumed about 40 dwelling houses and stores and 28 buildings of other descriptions.,Native Americans;war
ID317,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,27,inform,Richmond January 28. Extract of a letter from a Gentleman now residing at Quebec to his Correspondent in this City dated Jan. 9 1972Our humanity was deeply affected by the dreadful carnage made by the Indians. You may be assured that the number of Indians did not exceed 1000 and that nothing saved General St. Clair and the remainder of his army but the great quantity of plunder he left to the Indians; they were composed of various tribes and three-fourths of of them remained in the camp to plunder it and to take scalps the trophies of their victory; and he that got most when he returned to his nation acquired the greatest share of glory; hence only about 200 pursued. The loss of the Indians is under 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they have obtained at so easy a purchase and the riches they obtained by the plunder and the provisions they found will make them a more terrible foe than ever they have been; they boast of taking an amazing quantity of powder and arms which they wanted; many of them were only armed with spears and hatchets and I have no doubt but if another expedition should be set on foot that they will be met by three times the number of Indians. The indian tribes of nations who live many hundred miles back have all entered into an association and made the present war a common concern they to oppose what they call the common enemy. The warriors of the different tribes so united are not less than 15 or 20000; numbers of the chiefs of ten or twelve numerous nations were here last summer. Lord Dorchester advised them to make peace and offered his mediations; he told them he was at peace with the United States and could give them no assistance. Their answer was that the enemy was in their country and would not make peace with them but on term dishonourable and at the expense of their country and that they had determined to die before they would accept of such terms. They felt much dissatisfied with the answer they received and departed with a full determination to defend their country with the last of their blood.You may depend on it that many years will elapse and many thousand men be expended before the United States will by the present measures be able to possess the country in contest; and I may also add that I have great apprehensions that desolation and destruction will be the consequence on the frontiers of the Ohio this winter and next spring; I would to God some steps might be taken to prevent them. I have no doubt the country might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the expence already incurred by the different expeditions; the attempt to take the country from them by force is founded in unrighteousness and ought to be abandoned; besides if the American mean to have anytrade with them they are taking steps that will prevent it for many years to come.

The ineffectual attempts of last summer to prevent the future depredations of the Miamis and some other tribes of Indians and the barbarities before and since committed on the setlers must occasion other people to be very cautious of removing to places where they would hold their lives and property on a very precarious teure unless the arms of the State prove remarkably successful in their future attacks.,Native Americans

ID323,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,11,08,inform,Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Muskingum to his Friend in the City of Norwich (Connecticut) dated Nov. 24 1790.The prospect of peace from our frontiers seems to me to be vanished for the present; the troops from this garrison have this morning returned and the best account I can collect of the expedition is as follows: viz. the troops amounting to about 1200 militia and about 300 regulars after seventeen days march from Miami reached the great Miami village about 170 miles without any molestation except having a number of their pack-horse stole.–On their arrival they found the village deserted and all the valuable builder a short tarry they proceeded to neighings set on flames by the Indians. Afbouring villages without molestation and deftroyed five of them and a quantity of corn computed at fifteen thousand bushels which they found buried in different places and very large quantities of vegetables of every kind. The first opposition that was met with a party of about 150 Kentucky militia and thirty regular troops all under the command of Col. Hardin of Kentucky were detached from the main body lying in the great Miami village to pursue the track of a party of Indians which had the day before been discovered. After a pursuit of about six miles they came up with and were attacked by surprise by a body of Indians who were concealed in the thickets on every side of a large plain; and on the first onset the militia without exchanging a single fire made a most precipitate retreat and left the regular troops to stand the whole charge of the Indians; the conflict was short and bloody; the troops were soon overpowered by numbers and all fell except the two offiers and two or three privates after defending themselves at their bayonet points with the greatest possible obstinacy. Ensign Hartshorn of Franklin was one of the four that escaped and his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly circumstance of falling over a log in his retreat and by that means screening himself from the eye of his pursuers that from any other circumstance. Captain Armstrong who commanded the party likewise made his escape by plunging himself into a pond or swamp up to his neck within two hundred yards of the field of action where he remained the whole night as a spectator of the horrid scene of the War Dance performed over the dead and wounded bodies of the poor soldiers that had fallen the preceding day where their shrieks mixed with the horrid yells of the savages rendered his situation shocking. After this some few skirmishes succeeded but nothing material until the second capital action which happened two days after the army left the Miami village. At ten miles distance from the town the General ordered a halt and detached from four to five hundred militia and about sixty regular soldiers commanded by Major Wylls all under the command of Col. Harden with orders to march back to the town. On their first entrance into the town there appeared a small body of Indians who immediately fled at the first onset and by that means decoyed the whole body of militia by making their flight into different directions and encouraging the militia to pursue; by this means the regular troops were left alone and the Indians had effected their design; for the moment they found the small handful of regular troops detached from the main body of militia they commenced the attack with their whole force excepting the flying parties that had diverted the militia; and although they soon found some part of the militia returning on their back pursued their object of routing and destroying the troops; as the only sure plan of success; which after the bloody conflict on each side they effect. The regular troops all to nine including two commissioned officers were killed and disabled and a total defeat ensued. Among the slain were Major Wylls of Hartford and Lieut. Frothingham of Middletown. Of the militia it is said about an hundred were killed among whom were a number of brave and valuable characters. The Indians it appears from some cause did not think it prudent to pursue their successes from the field of action for most of the troops that were not killed or sorely wounded made their escape which they never could have done had the Indians pursued with their usual fury.Nothing can exceed the intrepidity of the Indians on this occasion; the militia they appeared to despise and with all the undautedness conceivable threw down their guns and rushed upon the bayonets of the regular soldiers; a great number of them fell; but being so far superior in numbers soon overpowered them for while the poor soldier had his bayonet in one Indiaman two more would sink their tomahawks in his head. The defeat of our troops was complete the dead and wounded were left on the field in possession of the savages.No damage of any consequence has been sustained in this part of the country from the Indians; but what effect the expedition may have on us as relates to our frontier it uncertain.– If the Western Indians have any idea of treating for peace we shall be safe; if not we are much exposed.,war;Native Americans

Many of the hailstones were as large as hens eggs–the common size was a little more than an inch in diameter. Twenty-give hours after it fell banks of it were measured at the foot of a hill and found to be 20 inches deep.The Saturday following great damage was ??? by hail at Shrewsbury country of Worcesster.August 15.

ID327,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,02,07,inform,CONGRESS. Wednesday Dec. 8.The SPEECH of George Washington Esq; President of the Congress on ??? the ???Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIN meeting you again I feel much satisfac tion on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of flourishing commerce. The progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock abroad as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary.In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of 3000000 of florins towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in Holland.–As well the exchange with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information.Since your last sessions I have received communication by which it appears that the district of Kentucke at present a part of Virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honour to both the par ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you.It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the north west side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity.These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended.The disturbed situation of Europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge in means and there by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil.Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it destresful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection.The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom whether improvement of a judicatory system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom whether im provements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether ??? ???process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts be not desirable through all the States.The patronage of our commerce of our merchants and seamen has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them either by express convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of the National authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect.The establishment of the Militia of a Mint of Standards of Weights and Measures of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance.Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favourite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents.Gentlemen of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIn perusing the various and weighty business of the present session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.

ID328,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,21,inform,The following it is said are the authentic particulars of General St Clair's expedition in America. The Miamis Indians had been for a long time extremely troublesome to the Americans and it was determined to drive them to the back country. General St. Clair completely accomplished this object; but on the 22d Oct. a detachment of 400 Americans fell in with the Indians on the River St. Joseph where a severe battle was fought. Many Indians were killed but the Americans lost the field; several Officers and 150 men were killed and they were not able even to bring off their wounded. This success will in all probability give the Indians new courage and induce them again to make head against the American army.,Native Americans

The immediate beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place. The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river are rapidly rising in value and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men who instead of being mere lookers on in quality of overseers and drivers would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe and make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and the mouth of Altamahaw is one of the most beautiful you can imagineabounding with everything that can make life comfortable besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end of Sapola with rather more water than that of Charleston.

There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance on different parts adjoining James river the exportations of which in the opinion of rational men ought to be considered as of the greatest importance to this state. These articles are coals and clays for the several colours of paint which may be had in any quantity and may be afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal from every discovery we have been able to make are inexhaustible; all the samples however that you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the surface and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with funds sufficient to take this matter in hand there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the United States with coal equally good with that from Europe and at a much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to our paints there are none better in the world and in quantity when manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the river of property and enterprize are beginning to turn their attention to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature it is thought that these two articles are by no means objects beneath their attention.Extract of a letter from Charleston Sept. 27.On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard Hubcaw a fine new brig calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice the property of Mr. Hary Grant and is to be called the Pringle.

We took up an old newspaper tore it into small pieces which we carefully folded and put into our pockets. The tavern keeper goes round the room and we very gravely drop our paper in his hat. The fiddler returns and the landlord with a cheerful face and an air of self approbation boasts of what he had been doing for him; It was I persuaded them to make the collection I made them give I went round to every one and see what I have got.

ID341,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,02,22,inform,From theJamaica Royal Gazette. Kingston Nov. 28.By late arrivals from Hispaniola we learn that the people are in quietness but still armed; and that the Governor who had been suffered to remain but the Intendent only having fled is perfectly submissive to the will of the people.For several days last week the weather at the north side and in some of the Liguanea Mountains blew in most alarming gusts and the cold is said to have been peculiarly sever; some plantain trees have been thrown down but we have yet heard of no material damage.The sloop Resolution has brought into port a part of his Majesty's 10th regiment of foot consisting of a serjeant and 29 privates having received them from on board the ship Commerce Foot from London off the East End on Thursday last the Commerce being destined for Savanna la Mar.Dec. 26. Late on THursday evening his Majesty's ship Amphion Captain Nichols returned to Port-Royal from the Spanish American coast. The Amphion was bound to Carthagena but was prevented by the jealousy of the Spaniards from entering that port. Accounts are said to be received by her that a revolt has taken place amongst the Indians in that quarter and that the Spaniards are demolishing the fortifications throughout the country which it has cost them so much labour and expence to raise; so appre hensive are they of the numbers and force of the malcontents should they possess themselves of any of those strong holds.We learn from Georgia that the treaty with the Indians to negotiate with Commissioners were appointed by the President of the United States has been broken off; and that Mr. M'Gillivray and his warriors have declared that nothing short of a cession of the territory between the rivers St. Mary and Altamaha will satisfy them; adding that no equivalent can be given to the Georgians for relinquishing their claim to the district in question as it is founded in usurpation. The views of Mr. M'Gillivray in making this requisition are evident as it is known that he wishes to establish a sea-port at St Mary's as well for thecommercial emolument as for the civilization of his countrymen by an intercourse with foreign States.,rebellion;weather;shipping news;shipping news;Native Americans;trade;foreign relations

They have also endowed public schools employed ??? and erected places of Public Worship.The Officers Non-commissioned Officers and Soldiers who served in the Continental army and established the Liberty of their Country have at last received a reward infinitely beyond their expectations but every way corresponding with the liberty of a great and rising Republic.Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Congress this last Session to each individual who served throughout the war; and to the defendants of those who fell in contending for the Rights of Nature and eequal proportion to those who served for a shorter period; and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real value to the injury of the Patriotic Veteran as has been the case of former grants he is allowed his option of taking its value in sterling money at the present market price from the Treasure of the States; or any part in land and the rest in moneya s may be most agreeable to the receiver.The Mint of the United States which was established two years since has begun to issue its hold and silver coin: the copper has been delivered some time. The gold coins are eagles half eagles and quarter eagles.The first is exactly five and forty shillings English money or ten American coin.The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half and quater which makes the courie of exchange simple and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Readers will perceive that ten quarter dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dollars the eagle.There is besides one more silver coin which is called a Dime and is the tenth part of a dollar.The copper coin is called a Cent and is the tenth part of a Dime.Six of the ships of war which were voted by Congress in November last are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by Midsummer next and will complete a fleet of ??? hundred guns.The city of Washington which in five years more will be the Capital of the United States will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Congress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence and c??? a full and complete view of every part of the city as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising ground near the banks of the Potamac possessing a delightful water prospect together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the city.From the President's house to the Capitol run two great pleasure parks or malls which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the Potomac and are ornamented at the sides by elegant buildings for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol as well as those of the President's house are of the finest marble. The building of these superb edifices has been much retarded by the want of stone cutters masons bricklayers carpenters and blacksmiths who at this time actually receive the enormous wages of ten shillings American currency per day.The district of Country at the back of North Carolina reaching to the Mississippi and covering a country six hundred miles long by three hundred broad is next winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the Province of Maine extending from the borders of New Hampshire to the river St. Croix is expected to form a Seventeenth.The new cities build in America since her independence are Grenville in the State of Georgia; Martenberg the Capitol of North Carolina; Columbia the Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and Nashville in the Tenesee Settlements; Danville Fairfield and Lex ington in the State of Kentucky; Washington the Capital of the United States; Sunbury in the State of Pennsylvania; Hudson upon Husdon's River and Cooper's Town in the State of New York; Bennington in the State of Vermont; and Paterson in the State of New Jersey.

The emigrations from the different nations in Europe to that country are esimated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually.

ID342,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,07,12,inform,Letters from Alexandria in Virginia dated the 9th May last mention that General Wayne had been dispatched in the beginning of March on an expedition against the Cherokee Miamis and Chickesau Indians who have for some time past had as their chief warrior one Macgillivray a Scotchman who has long resided among these Indians. General Wayne at the head of two thousand Provincials had completely routed them after a great slaughter. After the battle Macgillivray and his savages took refuge in the woods. General Wayne has destroyed the most part of the habitation of these Indians in the extent of 200 English miles along the river which is the boundary of Georgia after which he returned to Savannah. This defeat is so total that it will put it out of the power of these Indians to be again troublesome to the State of Virginia.,war;Native Americans
ID343,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,06,18,persuade,The American States having now gained their independence have no cause of quarrel let with this country; but matters are very different between them and Spain. It is well known that the Indians on the back settlements have been regularly supplied with arms and ammunition from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies to enable them to distress the Americans and prove at least a hindrance to their growing prosperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi has been denied them?and the Spaniards now in possession of the Floridas have been continually quarrelling with them about their boundaries.It may therefore be considered as almost certain that the American states will take an active part against Spain. This will be a great acquisition to Britain in every point of view; for though American cannot furnish money she can furnish men and provisions; and afree intercourse with her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the security of our West-India Islands.

On the passage from Africa nine of the seamen mutined whom Captain Hunter has brought confined in irons and they are to be tried at a Court of Admiralty Sessions.Feb. 20. Very strong suspicions are entertained by the Americans that the Indian Chief M' Gilveray and the nations under his immediate controul or in alliance with him are subsidied by the King of Spain. It is a well known fact that they are regularly supplied with cloathing arms and ammunition from the Royal Magazines at St. Augustine and Pensacola and therefore in all probability; the sword not the olive branch will be the most speedy and effectual agent for terminating the disputes.March 6.

Hunter came out with the earl of Effingham; it is therefore probable that the disputes which have so long subsisted between Lieutenant Colonel Despard and the inhabitants of the Bay of Honoduras will be brought to a speedy determination.At the sale of the late Peter Heningson's estatea negro blacksmith was sold for the extraordinary sum of two hundred and sixty pounds!At two o'clock on Tuesday morning the 3d regiment quitted the barracks in this town and at Up Park Camp and embarked on board the Chichester for Great Britain; the 14th at the same time taking possession of their quarters.Advice is received from St. Mark's in Hispaniola that on the 1st of this month a number of free people of colour to the amount of 700 and upwards having possessed themselves of several field pieces formed a camp in that districh and exhibited an appearance of hostility highly alarming. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent from the Assembly to demand the reason of so extraordinary a proceeding the insurgents demanded that a remonstrance which they then delivered to the deputies should be presented imimmediately to the general and that an answer thereto should be given without delay. The paper being conveyed as they desired proved to be a sensible and well written detail of the various claims the free people of colour had on what they termed the justice of the whites with whom they demanded an equal participation of all rights and immunities whatsoever–the privilege of representation and of qualifying for all the learned professions–and concluding with the avowal of a determination to proceed to extremities should their demands be treat with neglect.On the perusal of this paper it was judged adviseable to assemble a body of the militia who headed by the General immediately went against the camp. On their arrival the insurgents fired and fled to the mountains; three or four of the whites were killed and one of the ringleaders was taken and instantly beheaded.A proclamation was then issued offering a reward of 50 half joes for the head of any principal offender and in the course of a few days not less than twenty seven were brought in. On Sunday the 7th instant a very great majority of those who had formed the camp finding all their attempts completely frustrated came in and took the oath of allegiance to the nation. One or two of the principals for whom high rewards are offered are not yet taken.From Port Maria we have received the disagreeable account of the loss of the ship Lion Capt.

ID345,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,05,24,entertain,NOOTKA SOUND.The circumstances of thetrade and situation of this part of North America being a matter of such general conversation and great public moment we are particularly happy in being enabled to give some further account of the transactions that have happened at Nootka Sounds as well as to point out the advantages that were likely to be extended to other places by the means of this trade.It is necessary to remark that the skin of the sea otter is worn only in the Northern regions of China. Its fur though beautiful and magnificent is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of the Southern Provinces.Pekin is therefore the proper mart for this valuable commodity and in this immense city the consumption is so great that the produce of the voyage meets and immediate sale.The Mandarins of the Court and even the Emperor himself are fond of wearing this costly fur. To a citizen of common rank a sea otter's collar to his vestment is a luxury.The natives of the North West Coast of Ameerica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds that all the blankets cloths hats and stockings that could be procured in China if English manufacture weresold to the Indians with whose Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed.An act of cruelty committed by an officer of the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to be recorded.The Spaniards discovering that Callicum a Chief second in authority at Nootka Sound was in alliance with the English he was shot through the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife of Callicum with an infant child escaped but not till wounded.Macquilla the Chief first in command retired at the head of the allies of England from Nootka Sound and to avoid the cruelty of the Spaniards they fled to distant parts. Such of the natives as they could seize the Spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their fortifications.At this period it was in the contemplation of the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands with a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. And we further add on authority that amounts nearly to demonstration that on the very lands purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain Mears the Spaniards have already opened valuable mines.Another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of Kamschatka and other ports belonging to the Russians with the teas and other produce of China. This promised to be an invaluable channel of commerce as the Chinese have shut their ports against the Russians whoOn this voyage of discovery and experiment one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo but was unfortunately lost on her return to China.To these curious particulars we add with a patriot joy that the consumption of the glorious staple of England her broad cloths is astonishingly great in Japan and China: British hard ware &c. is also in great request.From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may depend on the utmost attention and civility.

ID347,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,02,21,inform,Richmond Virginia Dec. 1 1790.Extract of a letter from a Gentleman at Kentucky to a Member of the General Assembly dated Nov. 7 1790.I have been waiting with much impatience to obtain some certain account of our troops; many probably conjectures still fill the minds of the people. A hand-bill just come to Bourbon contains an extract of a letter from Governor St. Clair to General Wilkinson which mentions that our army had met with but little opposition. The Miami villages were abandoned from thence a detachment was sent up to St. Joseph's river which fell in with a party of Indians and had a severe engagement.General Harmar made a shew of retreating and marched about eight miles when he detached a strong party to the field of action in hopes of finding the Indians on the ground; as they expected so they found them and an action immediately commenced which was obstinate on both sides.A vast number of Indians were killed in crossing the St. Joseph's river. Major Fountain of Fayette and General Scott's son were killed the second fire; Capt. M'Murty and 73 militiamen were killed; Major Willis Lieut. Fotheringham of the F–deral troops and 77 privates also fell in the action.General Harmar did not send a single man to reinforce the detachment consisting of 400 men (who had to sustain the fire of the whole Indian army) although he had with him in camp upwards of 1100 men. Our men at last lost ground Colonel Harding's wing was beaten and finally broke. Lieutenant Colonel Hall of Bourbon and Majors M'Million and Willis broke the other wing of the Indians which occasioned the amazing slaughter in the river St. Joseph.General Harmar never sent to bring off the wounded nor bury the dead. Captain David Thrope and Lieut. Clark fell in the field. The Bourbon militia has suffered very much nearly one third of them having fallen on the spot.The army is now at Licking and is expected home hourly.This is the best account that I have been able to collect; it will be delivered to you by Major Jones who before he leaves the district may be enabled to obtain further particulars.,Native Americans

Intelligence has been received that in some trivial dispute with a native Indian a Spaniard has stabbed him to the heart with a stiletto and then fled. The nation to whom the Indian belonged being made acquainted with the murder sent a deputation to the Governor demanding that five Spaniards should be instantly delivered up as an attonement. This was peremptorily refused as being more than commensurate to the offence but the murderer was offered as a satisfaction; the Indians would not accept him singly and departed vowing the severest revenge: a few days afterwards intelligence was received that they had surprised and massacred sixteen men who had been at work in the woods; and when the vessel departed the Spaniards were flying with the utmost precipitation and terror from all parts of the country seeking shelter in the forts.,Native Americans;crime

The particulars relative to the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing they gave the Indian whoop and rushing on the flankets scalped them every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat but did no damage as it required some time to make their way into the river. After the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of about six days five or six boats happened to come down the river–the savages attacked the foremost of them in which were two young ladies of the name Macdonald a young gentleman and some others passengers and took it. Elevated with this easy capture they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight which they attacked with great fury–they were in three canoes each canoe containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat as it came down and commenced firing; after discharging their guns they retreated loading and came on a second time fired and repeated nine different times; as often as they come on there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat which contained nine fighting men;– during the conflict two were killed and five wounded; two only remained to protect the boat and prevent the Indians from boarding it which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ??? they threw billets of wood at them and one of them took up an ax as a weapon of defence should they persist in boarding which the Indians perceiving and as is supposed their ammunition being expended they retreated without accomplishing their object.These inhuman monsters previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes in which situation they were both killed. A few days after this transaction they fired at another boat and killed one young man. In short every boat tat has gone down the river lately has been fired at except our's. We saw no Indians; the places where the above depredation happened we passed in the night.Boston May 4.

An immense number of people assembled near the Quay and on board the vessels in the river which as well as works saluted him with several discharges of artillery. The day was afterwards devoted to conviviality–The lodge of St. John addressed his Excellency as follows:–Right Worshipful Sir We the Master Officers and Members of St. John's Lodge No. 2 of Newbern beg leave to hail you welcome with three times three! We approach you not with the language works have proved you to be the true and faithful Brother the skilful and expert Craftsmen the just and upright Man.But the powers of eloquence are too feeble to express with sufficient energy the cordial warmth with which our bosoms glow towards you–We therefore most frevently wish–more ardently and devoutly pray that the Providence of the Most High may strengthen establish and protect you in your walk through life–and when you are called off from your terrestrial labours by command of our divine grand master and your operations sealed with the mark of his approbation may your soul be everlastingly refreshed with the streams of living water which flow from the right hand of God. And when the Supreme Architect of all world's shall collect his most precious jewels as ornaments of the Celestial Jerusalem–may you eternally shine among those of the brightest lustre.To which the President returned the following answer:– Gentlemen I receive the cordial welcome which you are pleased to give me with sincere gratitude. My best ambition having aimed at the unbiassed approbation of my fellow citizens it is peculiarly pleasing to find my conduct so affectionately approved by a fraternity whose association is founded on justice and benevolence.In reciprocating the kind wishes contained in your address be persuaded that I offer a sincere prayer for your present and future happiness.George-Town. April 30.Yesterday morning about one or two o'clock the ship Termagant belonging to the house of Messrs. Claggen lying in the stream opposite this town was discovered on fire. The inhabitants of the town and the seamen in the harbour speedily collected but on account of a quantity of powder that was on board the efforts that otherwise would have been exerted to extinguish the flames were withholden. The first soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of the ship were flying in every direction and it and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting store and dwelling houses on the water side were prevented from sharing a similar fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse the property of Francis and Charles Loundes situated at some distance from the water wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stored was several times in different places on fire ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss occasioned by this alarming element must be great indeed as the ship was large and nearly new; besides there were goods to a considerable amount and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which (excepting a part of the money which has since been found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cabbin which by some means or other set fire to the sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was discovered. Providentially no lives were lost.Pittsburgh May 21. A letter received in this town on Sunday last from Lieut. Jeffers at Fort Franklin mentions that an Indian had arrived there who brought him intelligence that 300 warriors of the Chippawa and other nations had set out for war and that they were determined to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio near Petersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing but their destination was not known.,shipping news;weather;war;Native Americans;textiles;Native Americans;gambling;gambling;weather;longevity;Freemasons;Freemasons;fire;trade;Native Americans;war

On Saturday the 1st of July I left Tioga point near the middle of the day; about half after one o'clock P. M. a shower appeared to be rising from the north west and I had scarcely time to take shelter in the house of Obadiah Gore Esq; at Sheshequen before the storm came on attended with heavy thunder and lightening and a violent gale of wind with rain. The storm continued up wards of half an hour during which time to see the tumbling of timber during the storm was surprising. After it abated I continued on my journey but found it very difficult travelling in many places the road being blocked up by the falling of timber. I reached Wilksbarree on Wednesday. It appears that the storm extended through the country and at the same hour of the day blew more violent in some places than others. At Exeeter about nine miles from Wilksbarrie a level plain loaded with pitch pine timber was swept of its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile in length and three fourths of a mile wide being either torn up by the roots or twisted off leaving their stumps from 5 to 30 feet high.A number of buildings in different parts of the country stript of their roofs and otherways damaged–fences in many place removed and many fields of corn others grain and flax laid level with the earth–cattle killed by the falling of timber in every part of the country.A Mr. –Lot who lived at Mahooper about 35 miles from Wilksbarre whose family consisted of his wife and a number of children– he with his wife being absent children seeing themselves in danger in the house left it at the instant a large tree was falling; the tree reached them a small distance from the door and a girl about eleven years of age was crushed to pieces about expired instantly. One of the other children had a thigh and both arms broke another badly wounded in the head–these two it is feared has received the fatal blow two other slightly wounded.Extract of a letter from Richmond Virginia dated July 28.By accounts from Kentucky we are informed that about the 1st of this month a party of Indians appeared near Frankfort and took a great number of horses and negroes.

M'Dowell with 300 men pursued them to the Ohio; but not falling in with them he crossed the river leaving 100 men to take care of his horses; after marching about 12 or 15 miles overtook a large party when a severe engagement ensued but being overpowered by numbers was obliged to retreat. He then sent for the men left behind and came up with the Indians the next day and after engaging some time obliged them to make a precipitate retreat. Col. M'Dowell took six Indian warriors two Englishmen and a Frenchman from Detroit and all the negroes and horses.Newtown June 27.On the 13th instant the meeting house in Newtown was removed about eight rods the removal was effected in one hour and an half after previous preparations for the purpose had been made.

The representations which have been very forcibly urged by the American Minister Mr. Pinckney include various topics of complaint. Amongst these are the withholding of the poste of Niagara Detroit &c. in violation of the treaty of 1783; the exciting of the Creek and other Indians to make war upon the American frontier; the refusal to make compensation for the property seized by the armies under Lord Cornwallis &c in the Southern States according to stipulation; the seizure of American ships bound to France; the impressing of American citizens to man our fleets; and finally the sullen silence which the British Minister is alledged to have uniformly maintained on the subject of the claims made by the Republic.The American Minister has however so little hope of efficacy from these representations that he has ordered in his tradesman's bills and made every other preparation for an abrupt departure.Notwithstanding this a??miny aspect of affairs we still must hope that no consequences subversive of the pacific system at present subsisting between America and Great Britain will ensue; for illjudged and ignorant indeed of the true interests of his country must that Briton be (whatever his rank( who would advise another American war –a war which reasoning of the future by the sorrowful experience of the past can only serve to increase the sum and to swell the catalogue of human woe.,

ID368,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,07,25,advertise,LANDS in AMERICA for SALE.THESE two adjoining TRACKS of LAND in the County of FAYETTE and State of KENTUCKY. The one track consists of 7000 acres and is divided into 15 plantations of 500 acres each; eight of these plantations are still unsold and are now offered at the low price of 137l. being only 5s. 6d. per acre. The other track counsists of 3086 acres and is to be sold in one lot at 5s. 6d. per acre. There is a fine stream of water running through these two tracks of land which communicates with the great river Ohio so that Mills may be erect.In Fayette County is Lexington where the Courts of the State of Kentucky are held and where all public business is transacted Lexington is in the neighbourhood of these lands and Fayette county is the nearest and most convenient for Philadelphia Baltimore City of Washington &c. The soil of Kentucky is deep and black and lies upon a bed of lime-stone and coal. THe natural grown of the country are large walnuts honey poplar and sugar trees. The surface is covered with blue grass clover and wild rye grape vines running to the tops of the trees. Shrubs and plants grow spontaneously and afford a beautiful blossom of a rich and exquisite fragrance. Cotton and sugar are manufactured to advantage. wheat barley oats flax and hemp yield abundantly; indeed it is assumed that there have been raised 100 bushels upon one acre but the common produce is from 40 to 60 bushels an acre.Owing to the peculiar richness of the soil and fine climate of the country no part of America has been to repidly settled. The returns made to Congress upon 1st May 1792 state them at 76 000. In March 1793 there were upwards of 100000. And from their astonishing increase since they may be estimated at 200000. Eleven years ago Kentucky lay in a forest but now she exhibits an extensive settlement divided into seven populous counties in which are a great number of flourishing towns and contains more inhabitants than are in Georgia Delaware and Rhode Island States. There are about 70 churches in Kentucky and mostly PResbyterians. There is a College; and Schools are established in every town. There is a Printing-office; a Weekly Gazette published. There are Paper Mills O??? Mills ???ing Mills Saw Mills and a great number of Grist Mills. Considerable quantities of Sugar are made from the Sugar Trees. Salt-works are in every part of the country and the inhabitants are supplied at a low price.The taxes upon land are very low. Any person who goes from Europe becomes an American Citizen on his arrival in this new State and is entitled to be elected to any office in the Commonwealth.For farther particulars apply to MR.

ID369,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,11,inform,As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at the opening of the Congress of the United States at New York Nov. 6 gives an impartial account of the situation of that counttry we are persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers.Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives IT is some aba???of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally I am not able to add to it information that Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our western frontier have terminated.You will I am persuaded learn with no less concern than I communicate it that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of preserving hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the further effusion of blood–to arrest the progress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable puposes:–In making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the events or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable; to ascertain unequivocally the such is the case.A detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thu s far will I trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of some of them indeed is still depending; but a favourable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by any thing that has yet happened.In the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will I presume be duly considered whether the occasiondoes not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased.It must add to your concern to be informed what besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it.A part of the Cherokees known by the name of Chickamagas inhabiting five villages on the ??? river have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements.It was hoped that the treat of Holston made with the Cherokee nation in July 1791 would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unproved hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter.I have reason to believe that every predictable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete. And pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termintion of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable.In looking forward to the future expence of the operations which may be found inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year. This however will be better ascertained in the course of the session; and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds from the supposition of no material extention of the spirit of hostilities.I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all ??? plans must prove nugatory. To enable by ???ent rewards the employment of qualified ??? persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoing civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulation calction its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable.The prosperous state of our revenue had been intimated–This would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of ???duties on spirits distilled within the United States.These impediments have lessened and are ?ess???din local extent; and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the law app??? to be progressive.But symptoms of increased opposition have lately manifested themselves in certain quarters; I judged special interposition on my part proper and adviseable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for this object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in excution for bring to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto.Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders. And Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend on me shall be wanting ???sert and maintain the just authority of the law. In fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon the full co-operation of the other departments of the government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens.I cannot forbear to bring again into the view of the legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the supreme court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are being experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws considerations rise out of the,speeches
