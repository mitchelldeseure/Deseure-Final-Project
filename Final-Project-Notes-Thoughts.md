#Notes & Thoughts on My Final Project

##The Project Itself:
I chose to analyze the Colonial Newspaper Database provided by Professor Graham because I am becoming increasingly interested in the political media during colonial times. The newspapers are mainly from Britain but considering Canada was a British colony and our political systems were combined at the time it is really an incite at the history of Canadian politics too. 

##Topic Modeling:
I chose to centre my project around topic modelling because it will allow me to find those instances when articles are surrounded around political thought or expression and I can analyze through visualizations learned in the course. This way I am able to access all the information in the database to come to conclusions on the importance of political media during the end of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century.

##Process:
###This will be a detailed account of my final project and the steps I am taking.

**Step 1:**
The first thing I decided to do was organize a bunch of .cvs files in order to be able to create topics for decade specific times. It was not difficult to just quickly run through the original .cvs file of the Colonial Newspaper Database and hack it up into decades.

**Step 2:**
Next I decided it would be wise to do a couple preliminary searches for topics. By doing this I can get a grasp on what I may be able to expect in the results per decade and I can make an inital hypothesis on what my results are going to be long term.

To ensure I had the right number of topics for my data I created a set with 25, 15, and 10 topics and compared the topics to specificality. 

I decided I would stick to 15 topics for each decade and compare each accordingly. A lot can be learned just by examining the topics given. I'll analyze the core data of the topics and then add visualizations to help understanding.

**Step 3:**
